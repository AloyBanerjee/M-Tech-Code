      "null\t\" But I warn you, if you dont tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that AntichristI really believe he is AntichristI will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my faithful slave, as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I  have frightened yousit down and tell me all the news\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pvlovna  Schrer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Mrya Fdorovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" With these words she greeted Prince Vasli Kurgin, a man of high  rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna  Pvlovna had had a cough for some days\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was, as she said, suffering  from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St\"\n",
      "null\t\" Petersburg, used  only by the elite\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10Annette  Schrer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Heavens! what a virulent attack! replied the prince, not in the  least disconcerted by this reception\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on  his breast and a serene expression on his flat face\"\n",
      "null\t\" He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance  who had grown old in society and at court\"\n",
      "null\t\" He went up to Anna Pvlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,  and complacently seated himself on the sofa\"\n",
      "null\t\"  First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are\"\n",
      "null\t\" Set your friends mind at rest, said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony  could be discerned\"\n",
      "null\t\" Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times  like these if one has any feeling? said Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are staying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I  must put in an appearance there, said the prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" My daughter is  coming for me to take me there\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I thought todays fete had been canceled\"\n",
      "null\t\" I confess all these  festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome\"\n",
      "null\t\" If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off, said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force  of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosltsevs  dispatch? You know everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" What can one say about it? replied the prince in a cold, listless  tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has  burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale  part\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna Schrer on the contrary, despite her forty years,  overflowed with animation and impulsiveness\"\n",
      "null\t\" To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the  expectations of those who knew her\"\n",
      "null\t\" The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to  correct\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pvlovna burst out:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps I dont understand  things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war\"\n",
      "null\t\" She  is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our gracious sovereign  recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will  not forsake him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just  one\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?\"\n",
      "null\t\" She wanted to  find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions\"\n",
      "null\t\" What answer  did Novosltsev get? None\"\n",
      "null\t\" The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for  himself, but only desires the good of mankind\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and  that all Europe is powerless before him\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I dont believe a  word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either\"\n",
      "null\t\" This famous Prussian  neutrality is just a trap\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have faith only in God and the lofty  destiny of our adored monarch\"\n",
      "null\t\" He will save Europe!\"\n",
      "null\t\" I think, said the prince with a smile, that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King  of Prussias consent by assault\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are so eloquent\"\n",
      "null\t\" propos, she added, becoming calm again, I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best  French families\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is one of the genuine migrs, the good ones\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know that profound thinker? He has been  received by the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Had you heard?\"\n",
      "null\t\" But tell me, he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all  accounts is a poor creature\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress Mrya Fdorovna to secure it for  the baron\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was  pleased with\"\n",
      "null\t\" Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her  sister, was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" As she named the Empress, Anna Pvlovnas face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious  patroness\"\n",
      "null\t\" She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke  beaucoup destime, and again her face clouded over with sadness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The prince was silent and looked indifferent\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pvlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly  beautiful\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude\"\n",
      "null\t\" I often think, she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversationI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life  are distributed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why has fate given you two such splendid children?  I dont speak of Anatole, your youngest\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont like him, she  added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two such charming children\"\n",
      "null\t\" And really you appreciate them less than  anyone, and so you dont deserve to have them\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And she smiled her ecstatic smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I cant help it, said the prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lavater would have said I  lack the bump of paternity\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dont joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), he was mentioned at Her  Majestys and you were pitied\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,  awaiting a reply\"\n",
      "null\t\" He frowned\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know I did all  a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one\"\n",
      "null\t\" That  is the only difference between them\"\n",
      "null\t\" He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and  unpleasant\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with, said Anna  Pvlovna, looking up pensively\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my  children are the bane of my life\"\n",
      "null\t\" That  is how I explain it to myself\"\n",
      "null\t\" It cant be helped!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole? she  asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I dont feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who  is very unhappy with her father\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is a relation of yours, Princess  Mary Bolknskaya\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of  the head that he was considering this information\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know, he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And, he went on after a pause, what will it be in five years, if he goes on like this? Presently he added: Thats  what we fathers have to put up with\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is this princess of yours rich?\"\n",
      "null\t\" He lives in the country\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is  very clever but eccentric, and a bore\"\n",
      "null\t\" The poor girl is very unhappy\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is an aide-de-camp of Kutzovs and will be here tonight\"\n",
      "null\t\" Listen, dear Annette, said the prince, suddenly taking Anna  Pvlovnas hand and for some reason drawing it downwards\"\n",
      "null\t\" Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe  with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is rich  and of good family and thats all I want\"\n",
      "null\t\" And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honors hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro  as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction\"\n",
      "null\t\" Attendez, said Anna Pvlovna, reflecting, Ill speak to Lise, young Bolknskis wife, this very evening, and perhaps the  thing can be arranged\"\n",
      "null\t\" It shall be on your familys behalf that Ill  start my apprenticeship as old maid\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER II\"\n",
      "null\t\" The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age  and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vaslis daughter, the beautiful Hlne, came to take her father to the ambassadors entertainment; she wore a ball dress and  her badge as maid of honor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The youthful little Princess Bolknskaya,  known as la femme la plus sduisante de Ptersbourg, * was also there\"\n",
      "null\t\" She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did  not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince  Vaslis son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Abb Morio and many others had also come\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\" To each new arrival Anna Pvlovna said, You have not yet seen my aunt, or You do not know my aunt? and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her  aunt, Anna Pvlovna mentioned each ones name and then left them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna Pvlovna observed these greetings with mournful and  solemn interest and silent approval\"\n",
      "null\t\" The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her  Majesty, who, thank God, was better today\"\n",
      "null\t\" And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not  return to her the whole evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" The young Princess Bolknskaya had brought some work in a  gold-embroidered velvet bag\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she  occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip\"\n",
      "null\t\" As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defectthe shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouthseemed to be her own special and  peculiar form of beauty\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and  carrying her burden so lightly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life  and health\"\n",
      "null\t\" All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a  specially amiable mood that day\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a  pleasure to herself and to all around her\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have brought my work,  said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,  she added, turning to her hostess\"\n",
      "null\t\" You wrote that it was to be quite  a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed\"\n",
      "null\t\" And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray  dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast\"\n",
      "null\t\" Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone  else, replied Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, my husband is deserting me? He is going  to get himself killed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tell me what this wretched war is for? she added, addressing Prince Vasli, and without waiting for an answer she  turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a delightful woman this little princess is! said Prince  Vasli to Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable  at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat\"\n",
      "null\t\" This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezkhov, a well-known  grandee of Catherines time who now lay dying in Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his  first appearance in society\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna greeted him with the nod she  accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face  when she saw Pierre enter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which  distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid, said Anna Pvlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her  aunt as she conducted him to her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as  if in search of something\"\n",
      "null\t\" On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little  princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovnas alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the  aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestys health\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna in dismay detained him with the words: Do you know the  Abb Morio? He is a most interesting man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very  interesting but hardly feasible\"\n",
      "null\t\" You think so? rejoined Anna Pvlovna in order to say something  and get away to attend to her duties as hostess\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Pierre now  committed a reverse act of impoliteness\"\n",
      "null\t\" First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to  another who wished to get away\"\n",
      "null\t\" With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbs  plan chimerical\"\n",
      "null\t\"  We will talk of it later, said Anna Pvlovna with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready  to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag\"\n",
      "null\t\" As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pvlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,  proper, and regular motion\"\n",
      "null\t\" But amid these cares her anxiety about  Pierre was evident\"\n",
      "null\t\" She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and  again when he passed to another group whose center was the abb\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna  Pvlovnas was the first he had attended in Russia\"\n",
      "null\t\" He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing  any clever conversation that was to be heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always  expecting to hear something very profound\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an  opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER III\"\n",
      "null\t\" The spindles hummed  steadily and ceaselessly on all sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had  settled into three groups\"\n",
      "null\t\" One, chiefly masculine, had formed round  the abb\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hlne, Prince Vaslis daughter, and the little Princess  Bolknskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age\"\n",
      "null\t\" The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in  which he found himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna was obviously serving him up as  a treat to her guests\"\n",
      "null\t\" As a clever matre dhtel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pvlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abb, as peculiarly choice  morsels\"\n",
      "null\t\" The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the  murder of the Duc dEnghien\"\n",
      "null\t\" The vicomte said that the Duc dEnghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular  reasons for Buonapartes hatred of him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte, said Anna Pvlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something la Louis XV in the  sound of that sentence: Contez nous ela, Vicomte\"\n",
      "null\t\" The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to  comply\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to  listen to his tale\"\n",
      "null\t\" The vicomte knew the duc personally, whispered Anna Pvlovna to  one of the guests\"\n",
      "null\t\" The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur, said she  to another\"\n",
      "null\t\" How evidently he belongs to the best society, said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef  on a hot dish\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come over here, Hlne, dear, said Anna Pvlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of  another group\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\" She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautiful  woman\"\n",
      "null\t\" With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very much exposedand she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as  she moved toward Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hlne was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even  appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty\"\n",
      "null\t\" She  seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect\"\n",
      "null\t\" How lovely! said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her  unchanging smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience, said he,  smilingly inclining his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered  a reply unnecessary\"\n",
      "null\t\" She smilingly waited\"\n",
      "null\t\" From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pvlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honors face, and again relapsed  into her radiant smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Wait a moment, Ill get my work\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now then, what are you  thinking of? she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte\"\n",
      "null\t\" Fetch me my  workbag\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her  seat\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now I am all right, she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she  took up her work\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and  moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of  this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly\"\n",
      "null\t\" His features were like his sisters, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen  self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak\"\n",
      "null\t\" His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms  and legs always fell into unnatural positions\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its not going to be a ghost story? said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this  instrument he could not begin to speak\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why no, my dear fellow, said the astonished narrator, shrugging  his shoulders\"\n",
      "null\t\" Because I hate ghost stories, said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he  had uttered them\"\n",
      "null\t\" He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure  whether what he said was very witty or very stupid\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe  effraye, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The vicomte told his tale very neatly\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc dEnghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was  subject, and was thus at the ducs mercy\"\n",
      "null\t\" The latter spared him, and  this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death\"\n",
      "null\t\" The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked  agitated\"\n",
      "null\t\" Charming! said Anna Pvlovna with an inquiring glance at the  little princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Charming! whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story  prevented her from going on with it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pvlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abb, so she hurried to the  rescue\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abb about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young  mans simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why  Anna Pvlovna disapproved\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The means are \"\n",
      "null\t\" the balance of power in Europe and the rights of  the people, the abb was saying\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russiabarbaric as she is said to beto place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment Anna Pvlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,  asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Italians face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary  expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of  the climate, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not letting the abb and Pierre escape, Anna Pvlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the  larger circle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew  Bolknski, the little princess husband\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was a very handsome young  man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,  offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to  them\"\n",
      "null\t\" And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed  to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife\"\n",
      "null\t\" He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna  Pvlovnas hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You are off to the war, Prince? said Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" General Kutzov, said Bolknski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the generals name like a Frenchman, has been  pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Lise, your wife?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,  affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierres beaming face he gave him an  unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There now!\"\n",
      "null\t\" So you, too, are in the great world? said he to  Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I knew you would be here, replied Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will come to supper  with you\"\n",
      "null\t\" May I? he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the  vicomte who was continuing his story\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, impossible! said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing  Pierres hand to show that there was no need to ask the question\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasli and his  daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass\"\n",
      "null\t\" You must excuse me, dear Vicomte, said Prince Vasli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent  his rising\"\n",
      "null\t\" This unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me  of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am very sorry to leave  your enchanting party, said he, turning to Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" His daughter, Princess Hlne, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more  radiantly on her beautiful face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,  almost frightened, eyes as she passed him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very lovely, said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very, said Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" In passing Prince Vasli seized Pierres hand and said to Anna Pvlovna: Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me  a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever  women\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anna Pvlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" She knew his  father to be a connection of Prince Vaslis\"\n",
      "null\t\" The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince  Vasli in the anteroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety  and fear\"\n",
      "null\t\" How about my son Bors, Prince? said she, hurrying after him into  the anteroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tell me what  news I may take back to my poor boy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Although Prince Vasli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go  away\"\n",
      "null\t\" What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he  would be transferred to the Guards at once? said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can, answered Prince  Vasli, but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should  advise you to appeal to Rumyntsev through Prince Goltsyn\"\n",
      "null\t\" That would  be the best way\"\n",
      "null\t\" The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of  society had lost her former influential connections\"\n",
      "null\t\" She had now come to  Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasli that she had obtained an invitation to Anna Pvlovnas reception and had sat listening to  the vicomtes story\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vaslis words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;  then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vaslis arm more tightly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Listen to me, Prince, said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my fathers friendship for you; but now I entreat you for Gods sake to do this for my sonand I shall always regard you as a benefactor,  she added hurriedly\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, dont be angry, but promise! I have asked  Goltsyn and he has refused\"\n",
      "null\t\" Be the kindhearted man you always were,  she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Papa, we shall be late, said Princess Hlne, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she  stood waiting by the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized  if it is to last\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be  unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence\"\n",
      "null\t\" But in Princess Drubetskyas case he felt, after her second appeal,  something like qualms of conscience\"\n",
      "null\t\" She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in  his career\"\n",
      "null\t\" Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those womenmostly motherswho, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even  to make scenes\"\n",
      "null\t\" This last consideration moved him\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from youI knew your  kindness! He turned to go\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Waitjust a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards\"\n",
      "null\t\"  she faltered\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are on good terms with Michael Ilarinovich  Kutzov \"\n",
      "null\t\" recommend Bors to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at  rest, and then\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, I wont promise that\"\n",
      "null\t\" You dont know how Kutzov is pestered  since his appointment as Commander in Chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as  adjutants\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, but do promise! I wont let you go! My dear benefactor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Papa, said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,  we shall be late\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do promise, do promise, Vasli! cried Anna Mikhylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably  came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed  all the old feminine arts\"\n",
      "null\t\" But as soon as the prince had gone her face  resumed its former cold, artificial expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to  listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her task was  accomplished\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER V\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew looked Anna Pvlovna straight in the face with a  sarcastic smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dieu me la donne, gare qui la touche! * They say he was very fine when he said that, he remarked, repeating the words in  Italian: Dio mi lha dato\"\n",
      "null\t\" I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run  over, Anna Pvlovna continued\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sovereigns will not be able to  endure this man who is a menace to everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia, said the vicomte, polite  but hopeless: The sovereigns, madame\"\n",
      "null\t\" What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing! and he became  more animated\"\n",
      "null\t\" And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their  betrayal of the Bourbon cause\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sovereigns! Why, they are sending  ambassadors to compliment the usurper\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Cond  coat of arms on the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" He explained this to her with as much gravity  as if she had asked him to do it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bton de gueules, engrl de gueules dazurmaison Cond,  said he\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess listened, smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\" If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer, the vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, things will have gone too  far\"\n",
      "null\t\" By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French societyI mean good French societywill have been forever destroyed, and  then\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor Alexander, said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king, she concluded, trying to be amiable to the  royalist emigrant\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That is doubtful, said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Monsieur le Vicomte quite  rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far\"\n",
      "null\t\" I think it will  be difficult to return to the old regime\"\n",
      "null\t\" From what I have heard, said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to  Bonapartes side\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is the Buonapartists who say that, replied the vicomte without  looking at Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the present time it is difficult to know the  real state of French public opinion\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bonaparte has said so, remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic  smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his  remarks at him, though without looking at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it, Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting  Napoleons words\"\n",
      "null\t\" I opened my antechambers and they crowded  in\"\n",
      "null\t\" I do not know how far he was justified in saying so\"\n",
      "null\t\" After the murder of the  duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero\"\n",
      "null\t\" If to some people, he went on, turning to Anna Pvlovna, he ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one  hero less on earth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before Anna Pvlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomtes epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and though Anna Pvlovna felt sure he would say something  inappropriate, she was unable to stop him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The execution of the Duc dEnghien, declared Monsieur Pierre, was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole  responsibility of that deed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dieu! Mon Dieu! muttered Anna Pvlovna in a terrified whisper\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What, Monsieur Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul? said the little princess, smiling and drawing her  work nearer to her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh! Oh! exclaimed several voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" Capital! said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his  knee with the palm of his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre looked solemnly at his  audience over his spectacles and continued\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say so, he continued desperately, because the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,  he could not stop short for the sake of one mans life\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wont you come over to the other table? suggested Anna  Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, cried he, becoming more and more eager, Napoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the pressand only for that reason did he obtain  power\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have  called him a great man, remarked the vicomte\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He could not do that\"\n",
      "null\t\" The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great  man\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Revolution was a grand thing! continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme  youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, after that\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rousseaus Contrat Social, said the vicomte with a tolerant  smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide, again interjected an  ironical voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most  important\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon  has retained in full force\"\n",
      "null\t\" Liberty and equality, said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words  were, high-sounding words which have long been discredited\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and  equality\"\n",
      "null\t\" Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the  contrary\"\n",
      "null\t\" We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the first moment of Pierres outburst Anna Pvlovna, despite her social experience, was  horror-struck\"\n",
      "null\t\" But when she saw that Pierres sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in  a vigorous attack on the orator\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should like, said the vicomte, to ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hes a low fellow, say what you will, remarked Prince Hippolyte\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\" His  smile was unlike the half-smile of other people\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by anothera childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to  ask forgiveness\"\n",
      "null\t\" The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that  this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested\"\n",
      "null\t\" All were  silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" How do you expect him to answer you all at once? said Prince  Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish  between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" So it seems to me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, yes, of course! Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of  this reinforcement\"\n",
      "null\t\" One must admit, continued Prince Andrew, that Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he  gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but \"\n",
      "null\t\" but there are other acts  which it is difficult to justify\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierres remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to  go\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend, and asking them all to be seated began:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Excuse me, VicomteI must tell it in Russian or the point will be  lost\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian  as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their  attention to his story\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy\"\n",
      "null\t\" She must  have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones\"\n",
      "null\t\" That was her  taste\"\n",
      "null\t\" She said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She said\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh yes! She said, Girl, to the maid, put on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some  calls\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his  audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pvlovna, did however  smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She went\"\n",
      "null\t\" The girl lost her hat and  her long hair came down\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: And the whole world  knew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And so the anecdote ended\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pvlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolytes social tact in so agreeably  ending Pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst\"\n",
      "null\t\" After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and  where\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having thanked Anna Pvlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began  to take their leave\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre was ungainly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something  particularly agreeable before going away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides this he was  absent-minded\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the generals three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,  till the general asked him to restore it\"\n",
      "null\t\" All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by  his kindly, simple, and modest expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: I hope to see you again, but I also  hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, Opinions are  opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am\"\n",
      "null\t\" And  everyone, including Anna Pvlovna, felt this\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to his wifes chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also  come into the hall\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant  princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold, said the little princess,  taking leave of Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is settled, she added in a low  voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she  contemplated between Anatole and the little princess sister-in-law\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I rely on you, my dear, said Anna Pvlovna, also in a low tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Au  revoir! and she left the hall\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face  close to her, began to whisper something\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two footmen, the princess and his own, stood holding a shawl and  a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish\"\n",
      "null\t\" They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of  understanding but not wishing to appear to do so\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess as usual  spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am very glad I did not go to the ambassadors, said Prince  Hippolyte so dull\"\n",
      "null\t\" They say the ball will be very good, replied the princess, drawing  up her downy little lip\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the pretty women in society will be  there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not all, for you will not be there; not all, said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he  even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as  though embracing her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her  husband\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrews eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he  seem\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Are you ready? he asked his wife, looking past her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch  following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princesse, au revoir, cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well  as with his feet\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under  pretense of helping, was in everyones way\"\n",
      "null\t\" Allow me, sir, said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,  disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am expecting you, Pierre, said the same voice, but gently and  affectionately\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte  whom he had promised to take home\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, mon cher, said the vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, your little princess is very nice, very  nice indeed, quite French, and he kissed the tips of his fingers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hippolyte burst out laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,  continued the vicomte\"\n",
      "null\t\" I pity the poor husband, that little officer  who gives himself the airs of a monarch\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, And you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to  know how to deal with them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrews study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesars  Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle\"\n",
      "null\t\" What have you done to Mlle Schrer? She will be quite ill now, said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white  hands\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak\"\n",
      "null\t\" He lifted his eager  face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" That abb is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the  right light\"\n",
      "null\t\" In my opinion perpetual peace is possible butI do not  know how to express it \"\n",
      "null\t\" not by a balance of political power\"\n",
      "null\t\"  One cant everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a  diplomatist? asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Really, I dont yet know\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont like either the one or the  other\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But you must decide on something! Your father expects it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abb as tutor,  and had remained away till he was twenty\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abb and said to the young man, Now go  to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will agree to  anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Write  to me all about it, and I will help you in everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided  on anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking\"\n",
      "null\t\" But he must be a Freemason, said he, referring to the abb whom  he had met that evening\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That is all nonsense\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew again interrupted him, let  us talk business\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted  to tell you\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is a war now against Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierres childish words\"\n",
      "null\t\" He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other  answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this nave question\"\n",
      "null\t\" If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no  wars, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And that would be splendid, said Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew smiled ironically\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, why are you going to the war? asked Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What for? I dont know\"\n",
      "null\t\" I must\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it  had had in Anna Pvlovnas drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre removed his feet from  the sofa\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess came in\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew rose and politely  placed a chair for her\"\n",
      "null\t\" How is it, she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, how is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying  so, but you have no sense about women\"\n",
      "null\t\" What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cant understand why he wants to go to the war, replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their  intercourse with young women\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess started\"\n",
      "null\t\" Evidently Pierres words touched her to the  quick\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, that is just what I tell him! said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont understand it; I dont in the least understand why men cant live  without wars\"\n",
      "null\t\" How is it that we women dont want anything of the kind,  dont need it? Now you shall judge between us\"\n",
      "null\t\" I always tell him: Here  he is Uncles aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is so  well known, so much appreciated by everyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" The other day at the Aprksins I heard a lady asking, Is that the famous Prince  Andrew? I did indeed\"\n",
      "null\t\" She laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know  the Emperor spoke to him most graciously\"\n",
      "null\t\" Annette and I were speaking of  how to arrange it\"\n",
      "null\t\" What do you think?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  When are you starting? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, dont speak of his going, dont! I wont hear it spoken of, said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly  ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member\"\n",
      "null\t\" Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations  must be broken off \"\n",
      "null\t\" and then you know, Andr\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of  frigid politeness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I dont understand, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone  in the country\"\n",
      "null\t\"  With my father and sister, remember, said Prince Andrew gently\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Alone all the same, without my friends\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he expects me not to  be afraid\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a  joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the  gist of the matter lay in that\"\n",
      "null\t\" I still cant understand what you are afraid of, said Prince  Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, Andrew, I must say you have changed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, how you have\"\n",
      "null\t\" You had better go\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre looked over his spectacles with nave surprise, now at him and  now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here? exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful  grimace\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no  pity for me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why is it?\"\n",
      "null\t\" But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself  regret her words\"\n",
      "null\t\" But she went on hurriedly:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lise, I beg you to desist, said Prince Andrew still more  emphatically\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to  all this, rose and approached the princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seemed unable to bear the  sight of tears and was ready to cry himself\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because\"\n",
      "null\t\" I assure you  I myself have experienced \"\n",
      "null\t\" because \"\n",
      "null\t\" No, dont distress yourself\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of  the pleasure of spending the evening with you\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, he thinks only of himself, muttered the princess without  restraining her angry tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lise! said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch  which indicates that patience is exhausted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess pretty  face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husbands face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its  drooping tail\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! she muttered, and lifting her dress with one  hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead\"\n",
      "null\t\" Good night, Lise, said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand  as he would have done to a stranger\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER VIII\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead  with his small hand\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Let us go and have supper, he said with a sigh, going to the door\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore  that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married\"\n",
      "null\t\" Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talkas one who has long had something on his mind  and suddenly determines to speak out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Never, never marry, my dear fellow! Thats my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable  mistake\"\n",
      "null\t\" Marry when you are old and good for nothingor all that is  good and noble in you will be lost\"\n",
      "null\t\" It will all be wasted on trifles\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an  idiot!\"\n",
      "null\t\" and he waved his arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" My wife, continued Prince Andrew, is an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a mans honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to  whom I mention this, because I like you\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolknski who had lolled in Anna Pvlovnas easy chairs and with half-closed  eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant  light\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid  irritation\"\n",
      "null\t\" You dont understand why I say this, he continued, but it is  the whole story of life\"\n",
      "null\t\" You talk of Bonaparte and his career, said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), but Bonaparte when  he worked went step by step toward his goal\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was free, he had nothing  but his aim to consider, and he reached it\"\n",
      "null\t\" But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with  regret\"\n",
      "null\t\" Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and trivialitythese are  the enchanted circle I cannot escape from\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for  nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am very amiable and have a caustic wit, continued Prince  Andrew, and at Anna Pvlovnas they listen to me\"\n",
      "null\t\" And that stupid  set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is  right\"\n",
      "null\t\" Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everythingthats what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but theres nothing, nothing, nothing! No, dont marry, my dear fellow; dont  marry! concluded Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seems funny to me, said Pierre, that you, you should  consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have  everything before you, everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he  thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How can he talk like that? thought Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might  be best described as strength of will\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrews calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for  work and study\"\n",
      "null\t\" And if Pierre was often struck by Andrews lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a  sign of strength\"\n",
      "null\t\" Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels  that they may run smoothly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  My part is played out, said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you, he added after a silence,  smiling at his reassuring thoughts\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That smile was immediately reflected on Pierres face\"\n",
      "null\t\" But what is there to say about me? said Pierre, his face relaxing  into a careless, merry smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" What am I? An illegitimate son! He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great  effort to say this\"\n",
      "null\t\" Without a name and without means\"\n",
      "null\t\" For the  present I am free and am all right\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only I havent the least idea what  I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glancefriendly and  affectionate as it wasexpressed a sense of his own superiority\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our  whole set\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, youre all right! Choose what you will; its all the  same\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youll be all right anywhere\"\n",
      "null\t\" What would you have, my dear fellow? answered Pierre, shrugging  his shoulders\"\n",
      "null\t\" Women, my dear fellow; women!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Women who are comme il faut, thats a different matter; but the Kurgins set of women, women and wine I dont understand!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know? said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy  thought, seriously, I have long been thinking of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Leading such  a life I cant decide or think properly about anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ones head  aches, and one spends all ones money\"\n",
      "null\t\" He asked me for tonight, but I  wont go\"\n",
      "null\t\" You give me your word of honor not to go?\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was a  cloudless, northern, summer night\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre took an open cab intending  to drive straight home\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the nearer he drew to the house the more he  felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like  morning or evening than night\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurgin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind  Pierre was very fond of\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I should like to go to Kurgins, thought he\"\n",
      "null\t\" But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go  there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to  that he decided to go\"\n",
      "null\t\" The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; besides, thought he, all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same! Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying  all his decisions and intentions\"\n",
      "null\t\" Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,  and went in at the open door\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of  alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the  remains of supper\"\n",
      "null\t\" A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on  the sly what was left in the glasses\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and  general commotion\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously  round an open window\"\n",
      "null\t\" Three others were romping with a young bear, one  pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I bet a hundred on Stevens! shouted one\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Mind, no holding on! cried another\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I bet on Dlokhov! cried a third\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kurgin, you part our  hands\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There, leave Bruin alone; heres a bet on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  At one draught, or he loses! shouted a fourth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Jacob, bring a bottle! shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine  linen shirt unfastened in front\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wait a bit, you fellows\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: Come here; part the bets! This was Dlokhov, an officer of the Semnov regiment, a notorious gambler and  duelist, who was living with Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre smiled, looking about him  merrily\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I dont understand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats it all about?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening  to their chatter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole kept on refilling Pierres glass while explaining that Dlokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge  of the third floor window with his legs hanging out\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, I wont, said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up  to the window\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov was holding the Englishmans hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to  Anatole and Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dlokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  was about twenty-five\"\n",
      "null\t\" Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly  seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it  impossible not to notice his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov was a man of small means  and no connections\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dlokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him  more than they did Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov could play all games and nearly  always won\"\n",
      "null\t\" However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The bottle of rum was brought\"\n",
      "null\t\" The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of  the gentlemen around\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wanted to  smash something\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but  could not move it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He smashed a pane\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with  a crash\"\n",
      "null\t\" Take it right out, or theyll think Im holding on, said  Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Is the Englishman bragging?\"\n",
      "null\t\" First-rate, said Pierre, looking at Dlokhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of  the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window  sill\"\n",
      "null\t\" Listen! cried he, standing there and addressing those in the  room\"\n",
      "null\t\" I bet fifty imperialshe spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did not speak it very wellI bet fifty  imperials \"\n",
      "null\t\" or do you wish to make it a hundred? added he,  addressing the Englishman\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, fifty, replied the latter\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All right\"\n",
      "null\t\" that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)  and without holding on to anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is that right?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at himthe Englishman was shortbegan  repeating the terms of the wager to him in English\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wait! cried Dlokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window  sill to attract attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wait a bit, Kurgin\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to  accept this challenge or not\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating  Dlokhovs words into English\"\n",
      "null\t\" A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window  sill, leaned over, and looked down\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh! Oh! Oh! he muttered, looking down from the window at the  stones of the pavement\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Shut up! cried Dlokhov, pushing him away from the window\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, Dlokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered  his legs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to  the left, and took up the bottle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole brought two candles and  placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhovs back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit  up from both sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in  front\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre stood smiling but silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say, this is folly! Hell be killed, said this more sensible  man\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anatole stopped him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dont touch him! Youll startle him and then hell be killed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Eh?\"\n",
      "null\t\" What then?\"\n",
      "null\t\" If anyone comes meddling again, said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, I will throw him down  there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand  to balance himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the  window and from Dlokhovs back\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole stood erect with staring  eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw  himself on a sofa with his face to the wall\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed  horror and fear\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre took his hands from his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher  and his head tilting yet further back\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why is it so long? thought  Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly Dlokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip  as he sat on the sloping ledge\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he began slipping down, his head and  arm wavered still more with the strain\"\n",
      "null\t\" One hand moved as if to clutch  the window sill, but refrained from touching it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre again covered  his eyes and thought he would never open them again\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly he was  aware of a stir all around\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked up: Dlokhov was standing on the  window sill, with a pale but radiant face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its empty\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov  jumped down\"\n",
      "null\t\" He smelt strongly of rum\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theres a bet for you!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov stood frowning and did not speak\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre jumped upon the  window sill\"\n",
      "null\t\" Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? Ill do the same thing!  he suddenly cried\"\n",
      "null\t\" Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a  bottle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill do it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What next? Have you gone mad?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, you go  giddy even on a staircase, exclaimed several voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill drink it! Lets have a bottle of rum! shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to  climb out of the window\"\n",
      "null\t\" They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who  touched him was sent flying\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, youll never manage him that way, said Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wait a  bit and Ill get round him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Listen! Ill take your bet tomorrow,  but now we are all going to s\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Come on then, cried Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come on!\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,  and began dancing round the room with it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Bors on the evening of  Anna Pvlovnas soiree\"\n",
      "null\t\" The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Bors transferred into the regiment of Semnov  Guards with the rank of cornet\"\n",
      "null\t\" He received, however, no appointment to Kutzovs staff despite all Anna Mikhylovnas endeavors and  entreaties\"\n",
      "null\t\" Soon after Anna Pvlovnas reception Anna Mikhylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rostvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling Bry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from  childhood and lived for years at a time\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in  Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivlov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It was St\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natalias day and the name day of two of the Rostvsthe  mother and the youngest daughterboth named Nataly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ever since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostvas big house on  the Povarskya, so well known to all Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in  relays\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type  of face, evidently worn out with childbearingshe had had twelve\"\n",
      "null\t\" A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a  distinguished air which inspired respect\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Anna Mikhylovna Drubetskya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the  drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors\"\n",
      "null\t\" The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to  take part in receiving the visitors\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count met the guests and saw  them off, inviting them all to dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher, or ma chrehe called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, my dear, whether they were above or below him in rankI thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name  day we are keeping\"\n",
      "null\t\" But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma chre! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher! These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the  same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking  his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dmtri Vaslevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: Well, Dmtri, youll see that things are all as they should be? Thats right! The great thing is the serving,  thats it\"\n",
      "null\t\" And with a complacent sigh he would return to the  drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mrya Lvvna Kargina and her daughter! announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing  room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold  snuffbox with her husbands portrait on it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Im quite worn out by these callers\"\n",
      "null\t\" However, Ill see her and  no more\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is so affected\"\n",
      "null\t\" A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling  daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dear Countess, what an age\"\n",
      "null\t\" She has been laid up, poor child \"\n",
      "null\t\" and Countess Aprksina \"\n",
      "null\t\" came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and  the scraping of chairs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses  and say, I am so delighted\"\n",
      "null\t\" and Countess  Aprksina\"\n",
      "null\t\" and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put  on cloaks or mantles, and drive away\"\n",
      "null\t\" The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherines day, Count Bezkhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pvlovnas  reception\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I am so sorry for the poor count, said the visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is that? asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of  Count Bezkhovs distress some fifteen times\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats what comes of a modern education, exclaimed the visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible  things that he has been expelled by the police\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You dont say so! replied the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He chose his friends badly, interposed Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vaslis son, he, and a certain Dlokhov have, it is said,  been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezkhovs son sent  back to Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole Kurgins father managed somehow to get his  sons affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But what have they been up to? asked the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" They are regular brigands, especially Dlokhov, replied the  visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is a son of Mrya Ivnovna Dlokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka  Canal\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear! shouted  the count, dying with laughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was all they could do to rescue the poor man, continued the  visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" And to think it is Cyril Vladmirovich Bezkhovs son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so  well educated and clever\"\n",
      "null\t\" This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in  spite of his money\"\n",
      "null\t\" They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite  declined: I have my daughters to consider\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why do you say this young man is so rich? asked the countess,  turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention\"\n",
      "null\t\" His children are all illegitimate\"\n",
      "null\t\" I think Pierre also is  illegitimate\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The visitor made a gesture with her hand\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I should think he has a score of them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Anna Mikhylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in  society\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fact of the matter is, said she significantly, and also in a  half whisper, everyone knows Count Cyrils reputation\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has  lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite\"\n",
      "null\t\" How handsome the old man still was only a year ago! remarked the  countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have never seen a handsomer man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, as I was saying, Prince Vasli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his deathand he is  so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lorrain has come from Petersburgno one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre  or Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know  it all very well for Prince Vasli told me himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides, Cyril  Vladmirovich is my mothers second cousin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hes also my Brys godfather, she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the  fact\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli arrived in Moscow yesterday\"\n",
      "null\t\" I hear he has come on  some inspection business, remarked the visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, but between ourselves, said the princess, that is a  pretext\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladmirovich,  hearing how ill he is\"\n",
      "null\t\" But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke, said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the  young ladies\"\n",
      "null\t\" I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!\"\n",
      "null\t\" So do come and dine with us!  he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XI\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they  now rose and took their leave\"\n",
      "null\t\" The visitors daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock,  darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident  that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far\"\n",
      "null\t\" Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short  jacket\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide  and threw them round the little girl who had run in\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, here she is! he exclaimed laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" My pet, whose name day  it is\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear pet!\"\n",
      "null\t\" You spoil her, Ily, she added, turning to her  husband\"\n",
      "null\t\" How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name  day, said the visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a charming child, she added,  addressing the mother\"\n",
      "null\t\" This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of lifewith childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slipperswas just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not  yet a young woman\"\n",
      "null\t\" Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mothers mantillanot paying the least  attention to her severe remarkand began to laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced  from the folds of her frock\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Do you see?\"\n",
      "null\t\" was all Natsha  managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny)\"\n",
      "null\t\" She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even  the prim visitor could not help joining in\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you, said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning  to the visitor she added: She is my youngest girl\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantilla,  glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face\"\n",
      "null\t\" The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it  necessary to take some part in it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tell me, my dear, said she to Natsha, is Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?\"\n",
      "null\t\" She did not reply, but looked at her seriously\"\n",
      "null\t\" Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the  weather, and Countess Aprksina\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now and then they glanced at one  another, hardly able to suppress their laughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,  were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate  features\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas blushed when he entered  the drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" He evidently tried to find something to say, but  failed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked  right across the skull\"\n",
      "null\t\" She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as  fast as her nimble little feet would carry her\"\n",
      "null\t\" You were meaning to go out, werent you, Mamma? Do you want the  carriage? he asked his mother with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready, she answered,  returning his smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bors quietly left the room and went in search of Natsha\"\n",
      "null\t\" The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been  disturbed\"\n",
      "null\t\" The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person),  were Nicholas and Snya, the niece\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but  graceful and muscular arms and neck\"\n",
      "null\t\" By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown  kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat\"\n",
      "null\t\" She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as  they too could, like Natsha and Bors, escape from the drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah yes, my dear, said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, his friend Bors has become an officer, and so for friendships sake he is leaving the university and me, his  old father, and entering the military service, my dear\"\n",
      "null\t\" And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isnt  that friendship? remarked the count in an inquiring tone\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But they say that war has been declared, replied the visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyve been saying so a long while, said the count, and  theyll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" My  dear, theres friendship for you, he repeated\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hes joining  the hussars\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its not at all from friendship, declared Nicholas, flaring  up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is not from  friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation\"\n",
      "null\t\" He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both  regarding him with a smile of approbation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Schubert, the colonel of the Pvlograd Hussars, is dining with us  today\"\n",
      "null\t\" It cant be helped! said the count, shrugging his shoulders and  speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have already told you, Papa, said his son, that if you  dont wish to let me go, Ill stay\"\n",
      "null\t\" But I know I am no use anywhere  except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk\"\n",
      "null\t\"I  dont know how to hide what I feel\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Snya and the young  lady visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment  to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All right, all right! said the old count\"\n",
      "null\t\" He always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he  rose from an ensign and became Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, well, God grant it, he  added, not noticing his visitors sarcastic smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The elders began talking about Bonaparte\"\n",
      "null\t\" Julie Kargina turned to  young Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What a pity you werent at the Arkhrovs on Thursday\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was so  dull without you, said she, giving him a tender smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart  of Snya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the midst of his talk  he glanced round at her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile  on her lips, she got up and left the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" All Nicholas animation  vanished\"\n",
      "null\t\" He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then  with a distressed face left the room to find Snya\"\n",
      "null\t\" How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their  sleeves! said Anna Mikhylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Cousinagedangereux voisinage, * she added\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, and how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in  them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy\"\n",
      "null\t\" One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both  for girls and boys\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It all depends on the bringing up, remarked the visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, youre quite right, continued the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Till now I have always, thank God, been my childrens friend and had their full confidence, said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who  imagine that their children have no secrets from them\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know I shall always be my daughters first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy cant help it), he  will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters, chimed in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding  that everything was splendid\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats one to do, my dear?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Takes after me! And what a voice she has; though shes my daughter, I tell the truth when I say shell be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an  Italian to give her lessons\"\n",
      "null\t\" Isnt she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train  it at that age\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh no, not at all too young! replied the count\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, our  mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And shes in love with Bors already\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just fancy! said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Bors and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: Now you see if I  were to be severe with her and to forbid it \"\n",
      "null\t\" goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly (she meant that they would be kissing),  but as it is, I know every word she utters\"\n",
      "null\t\" She will come running to  me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps I  spoil her, but really that seems the best plan\"\n",
      "null\t\" With her elder sister I  was stricter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I was brought up quite differently, remarked the handsome  elder daughter, Countess Vra, with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the smile did not enhance Vras beauty as smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,  expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyonethe visitors and countess aliketurned to look at her as if wondering why she had  said it, and they all felt awkward\"\n",
      "null\t\" People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to  make something exceptional of them, said the visitor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too  clever with Vra, said the count\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, what of that? Shes  turned out splendidly all the same, he added, winking at Vra\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" What manners! I thought they would never go, said the countess,  when she had seen her guests out\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Natsha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the  conservatory\"\n",
      "null\t\" There she paused and stood listening to the conversation  in the drawing room, waiting for Bors to come out\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young mans discreet steps approaching  neither quickly nor slowly\"\n",
      "null\t\" At this Natsha dashed swiftly among the  flower tubs and hid there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined  his handsome face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, very still, peered out from her ambush,  waiting to see what he would do\"\n",
      "null\t\" He stood a little while before the  glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha was about to  call him but changed her mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let him look for me, thought she\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watchingas  under an invisible capto see what went on in the world\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was  experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya, muttering to herself,  kept looking round toward the drawing room door\"\n",
      "null\t\" It opened and Nicholas  came in\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya, what is the matter with you? How can you? said he, running  up to her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its nothing, nothing; leave me alone! sobbed Snya\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, I know what it is\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Snya did not pull it away, and left off crying\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, not stirring  and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" What will happen now? thought she\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are  everything! said Nicholas\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I will prove it to you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, then, I wont; only forgive me, Snya! He drew her to him  and kissed her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, how nice, thought Natsha; and when Snya and Nicholas had  gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Bors to her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bors, come here, said she with a sly and significant look\"\n",
      "null\t\" I  have something to tell you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here, here! and she led him into the  conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bors followed her, smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What is the something? asked he\"\n",
      "null\t\" She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown  down on one of the tubs, picked it up\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kiss the doll, said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not  reply\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you want to? Well, then, come here, said she, and  went further in among the plants and threw down the doll\"\n",
      "null\t\" Closer,  closer! she whispered\"\n",
      "null\t\" She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and  fear appeared on her flushed face\"\n",
      "null\t\" And me? Would you like to kiss me? she whispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from  excitement\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bors blushed\"\n",
      "null\t\" How funny you are! he said, bending down to her and blushing still  more, but he waited and did nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing  back her hair, kissed him full on the lips\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs  and stood, hanging her head\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Natsha, he said, you know that I love you, but\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You are in love with me? Natsha broke in\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, I am, but please dont let us do like that\"\n",
      "null\t\" In another four  years \"\n",
      "null\t\" then I will ask for your hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, she counted on her slender  little fingers\"\n",
      "null\t\" All right! Then its settled?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Settled! replied Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Forever? said the little girl\"\n",
      "null\t\" Till death itself?\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XIV\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess wished to have a tte--tte talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikhylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from  Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face,  drew her chair nearer to that of the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\"  With you I will be quite frank, said Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" There are not many left of us old friends! Thats why I so value your  friendship\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anna Mikhylovna looked at Vra and paused\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess pressed her  friends hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vra, she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite, how is it you have so little tact? Dont you see you are  not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The handsome Vra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone, she replied  as she rose to go to her own room\"\n",
      "null\t\" But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,  one pair at each window\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the  first he had ever written\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors and Natsha were at the other window  and ceased talking when Vra entered\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya and Natsha looked at  Vra with guilty, happy faces\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but  apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vra\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How often have I asked you not to take my things? she said\"\n",
      "null\t\" You  have a room of your own, and she took the inkstand from Nicholas\"\n",
      "null\t\"  In a minute, in a minute, he said, dipping his pen\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You always manage to do things at the wrong time, continued Vra\"\n",
      "null\t\" You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed  of you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one  replied, and the four simply looked at one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" She lingered in the  room with the inkstand in her hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now, Vra, what does it matter to you? said Natsha in defense,  speaking very gently\"\n",
      "null\t\" She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to  everyone\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very silly, said Vra\"\n",
      "null\t\" Secrets indeed!\"\n",
      "null\t\" We dont interfere with you and Berg\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should think not, said Vra, because there can never be  anything wrong in my behavior\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Ill just tell Mamma how you are  behaving with Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Natlya Ilynchna behaves very well to me, remarked Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" I  have nothing to complain of\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont, Bors! You are such a diplomat that it is really  tiresome, said Natsha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly\"\n",
      "null\t\" (She used the word diplomat, which was just then much in vogue  among the children, in the special sense they attached to it\"\n",
      "null\t\") Why does she bother me? And she added, turning to Vra, Youll  never understand it, because youve never loved anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more (this nickname, bestowed on Vra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with  Berg as much as you please, she finished quickly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, now youve done what you wanted, put in Nicholassaid  unpleasant things to everyone and upset them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lets go to the  nursery\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The unpleasant things were said to me, remarked Vra, I said  none to anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis! shouted laughing voices  through the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" The handsome Vra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been  said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf\"\n",
      "null\t\" Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and  calmer\"\n",
      "null\t\"  In the drawing room the conversation was still going on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my dear, said the countess, my life is not all roses  either\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont I know that at the rate we are living our means wont  last long? Its all the Club and his easygoing nature\"\n",
      "null\t\" Even in the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But dont lets talk about me; tell me how you managed  everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" I often wonder at you, Annettehow at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! Its  quite astonishing\"\n",
      "null\t\" How did you get things settled? I couldnt possibly  do it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my love, answered Anna Mikhylovna, God grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction! One learns many things then, she added with a certain  pride\"\n",
      "null\t\" When I want to see one of those big people I write a note: Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So, and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or  four timestill I get what I want\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont mind what they think of  me\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, and to whom did you apply about Bry? asked the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas  is going as a cadet\"\n",
      "null\t\" To whom did you apply?\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was so kind\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Has Prince Vasli aged much? asked the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have not  seen him since we acted together at the Rumyntsovs theatricals\"\n",
      "null\t\" I  expect he has forgotten me\"\n",
      "null\t\" He paid me attentions in those days, said  the countess, with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is just the same as ever, replied Anna Mikhylovna,  overflowing with amiability\"\n",
      "null\t\" His position has not turned his head  at all\"\n",
      "null\t\" He said to me, I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear  Princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very  kind relation\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one, continued Anna Mikhylovna, sadly,  dropping her voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no  progress\"\n",
      "null\t\" Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and dont  know how to equip Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" She took out her handkerchief and began to  cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble  note\"\n",
      "null\t\" My only hope now is in Count Cyril  Vladmirovich Bezkhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he will not assist his godsonyou know he is Brys godfatherand allow him something for his maintenance,  all my trouble will have been thrown away\"\n",
      "null\t\" I shall not be able to  equip him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence\"\n",
      "null\t\" I often think, though, perhaps its a sin, said the princess, that here lives Count Cyril Vladmirovich Bezkhov so rich, all  alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" that tremendous fortune\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Surely he will leave something to Bors, said the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish\"\n",
      "null\t\" Still, I will take Bors and go to see him at once, and I shall speak  to him straight out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let people think what they will of me, its  really all the same to me when my sons fate is at stake\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  princess rose\"\n",
      "null\t\" There  will just be time\"\n",
      "null\t\" And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikhylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the  anteroom with him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Good-by, my dear, said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, Wish me  good luck\"\n",
      "null\t\" Are you going to Count Cyril Vladmirovich, my dear? said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:  If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has been to the  house, you know, and danced with the children\"\n",
      "null\t\" Be sure to invite him, my  dear\"\n",
      "null\t\" We will see how Tars distinguishes himself today\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear Bors, said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her sons arm, be affectionate and  attentive to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Cyril Vladmirovich is your godfather after  all, and your future depends on him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Remember that, my dear, and be nice  to him, as you so well know how to be\"\n",
      "null\t\" If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" answered her son coldly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Although the hall porter saw someones carriage standing at the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the ladys old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse  today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\"  We may as well go back, said the son in French\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear! exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand  on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking  off his cloak\"\n",
      "null\t\" My friend, said Anna Mikhylovna in gentle tones, addressing  the hall porter, I know Count Cyril Vladmirovich is very ill\"\n",
      "null\t\"  thats why I have come\"\n",
      "null\t\" I shall not disturb him,  my friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" I only need see Prince Vasli Sergevich: he is staying  here, is he not? Please announce me\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned  away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Drubetskya to see Prince Vasli Sergevich, he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,  who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing\"\n",
      "null\t\" The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly  ascended the carpeted stairs\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear, she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch, you promised me!\"\n",
      "null\t\" They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the  apartments assigned to Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasli came outwearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast, as was his custom when at hometaking leave of a good-looking,  dark-haired man\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince, humanum est errare, * but\"\n",
      "null\t\" replied the doctor, swallowing his rs, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French  accent\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * To err is human\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very well, very well\"\n",
      "null\t\" Seeing Anna Mikhylovna and her son, Prince Vasli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of  inquiry\"\n",
      "null\t\" The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly  clouded his mothers face, and he smiled slightly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear invalid? said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look  fixed on her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli stared at her and at Bors questioningly and perplexed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors bowed politely\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikhylovna, answering her query by a movement of the  head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Is it possible? exclaimed Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, how awful!  It is terrible to think\"\n",
      "null\t\" This is my son, she added, indicating  Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wanted to thank you himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Believe me, Prince, a mothers heart will never forget what you  have done for us\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikhylovna, said Prince Vasli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikhylovna whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he  had done in Petersburg at Anna Schrers reception\"\n",
      "null\t\" Try to serve well and show yourself worthy, added he, addressing  Bors with severity\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am glad\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency, replied Bors, betraying neither annoyance at the princes brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly  and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am living at Countess Rostvas, replied Bors, again  adding, your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is, with Ily Rostv who married Nataly Shinshin, said  Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I know, I know, answered Prince Vasli in his monotonous voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,  I am told\"\n",
      "null\t\" But a very kind man, Prince, said Anna Mikhylovna with a pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostv deserved this  censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man\"\n",
      "null\t\" What do the doctors say? asked the princess after a pause, her worn face  again expressing deep sorrow\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They give little hope, replied the prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me  and Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is his godson, she added, her tone suggesting that  this fact ought to give Prince Vasli much satisfaction\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli became thoughtful and frowned\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezkhovs fortune,  and hastened to reassure him\"\n",
      "null\t\" If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle, said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, I  know his character: noble, upright \"\n",
      "null\t\" but you see he has no one with  him except the young princesses\"\n",
      "null\t\" They are still young\"\n",
      "null\t\" We women, Prince, and she smiled tenderly, always know how to say  these things\"\n",
      "null\t\" I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for  me\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am used to suffering\"\n",
      "null\t\" Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna  Mikhylovna? said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" The doctors are  expecting a crisis\"\n",
      "null\t\" But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the  welfare of his soul is at stake\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, it is awful: the duties of a  Christian\"\n",
      "null\t\" A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the  counts niece, entered with a cold, stern face\"\n",
      "null\t\" The length of her  body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli  turned to her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, how is he?\"\n",
      "null\t\" said the  princess, looking at Anna Mikhylovna as at a stranger\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you, said Anna Mikhylovna with a  happy smile, ambling lightly up to the counts niece\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have come,  and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle\"\n",
      "null\t\" I imagine what you  have gone through, and she sympathetically turned up her eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as Anna Mikhylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasli to  take a seat beside her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors, she said to her son with a smile, I shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile  and dont forget to give him the Rostvs invitation\"\n",
      "null\t\" They ask him  to dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" I suppose he wont go? she continued, turning to the  prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the contrary, replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed, I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young  man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him\"\n",
      "null\t\" A footman conducted Bors down one flight of  stairs and up another, to Pierres rooms\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and  sent to Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" The story told about him at Count Rostvs was true\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his fathers  house\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his fatherwho were never favorably disposed toward himwould have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to  his fathers part of the house\"\n",
      "null\t\" Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom  were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the  eldest who was readingthe one who had met Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her  much prettier\"\n",
      "null\t\" The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked  by the amusing scene she foresaw\"\n",
      "null\t\" She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying  to make out the pattern\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How do you do, cousin? said Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" You dont recognize me?\"\n",
      "null\t\" How is the count? Can I see him? asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,  but unabashed\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you  have done your best to increase his mental sufferings\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Can I see the count? Pierre again asked\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hm\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Olga, go and see whether Uncles beef tea is readyit is almost time, she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,  Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Olga went out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and  said: Then I will go to my rooms\"\n",
      "null\t\" You will let me know when I can see  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the  sister with the mole\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Next day Prince Vasli had arrived and settled in the counts house\"\n",
      "null\t\" He sent for Pierre and said to him: My dear fellow, if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that  is all I have to say to you\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count is very, very ill, and you must  not see him at all\"\n",
      "null\t\" Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in  his rooms upstairs\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Bors appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering  indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating\"\n",
      "null\t\" England is done for, said he, scowling and pointing his finger  at someone unseen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the  rights of man, is sentenced to\"\n",
      "null\t\" But before Pierrewho at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured Londoncould pronounce Pitts sentence, he saw a well-built and  handsome young officer entering his room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre paused\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Do you remember me? asked Bors quietly with a pleasant smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not  well\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, it seems he is ill\"\n",
      "null\t\" People are always disturbing him,  answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least  embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Rostv asks you to come to dinner today, said he, after a  considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, Count Rostv! exclaimed Pierre joyfully\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then you are his  son, Ily? Only fancy, I didnt know you at first\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you remember  how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its such an  age\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are mistaken, said Bors deliberately, with a bold and  slightly sarcastic smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am Bors, son of Princess Anna  Mikhylovna Drubetskya\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, the father, is Ily, and his son is  Nicholas\"\n",
      "null\t\" I never knew any Madame Jacquot\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh dear, what am I thinking about? Ive mixed everything up\"\n",
      "null\t\" One  has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Bors? Of course\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, now  we know where we are\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the  Channel\"\n",
      "null\t\" If only Villeneuve doesnt make a mess of things!\"\n",
      "null\t\" We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal  than with politics, said he in his quiet ironical tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know  nothing about it and have not thought about it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Moscow is chiefly busy  with gossip, he continued\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just now they are talking about you and  your father\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companions  sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Bors spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into  Pierres eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip, Bors went on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,  though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, it is all very horrid, interrupted Pierre, very horrid\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say  something disconcerting to himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" And it must seem to you, said Bors flushing slightly, but not changing his tone or attitude, it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man?\"\n",
      "null\t\" But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are  quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people\"\n",
      "null\t\" We are very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your father is rich, I dont regard myself as a relation of his, and  neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him\"\n",
      "null\t\" For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Bors under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Bors, began to speak with a feeling  of mingled shame and vexation\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I\"\n",
      "null\t\" who could think?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But Bors again interrupted him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I am glad I have spoken out fully\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me, said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put  at ease by him, but I hope I have not offended you\"\n",
      "null\t\" I always make it  a rule to speak out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the Rostvs?\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, but I say, said Pierre, calming down, you are a wonderful  fellow! What you have just said is good, very good\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of course you  dont know me\"\n",
      "null\t\" not since we  were children\"\n",
      "null\t\" You might think that I\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its queer, he added after a pause, that you should have suspected  me! He began to laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, what of it! I hope well get better  acquainted, and he pressed Bors hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know, I have not  once been in to see the count\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre saw that Bors wished to change the subject, and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the  Boulogne expedition\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A footman came in to summon Borsthe princess was going\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, in order to make Bors better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles  into Bors eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,  intelligent, and resolute young man\"\n",
      "null\t\" As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up  his mind that they would be friends\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli saw the princess off\"\n",
      "null\t\" She held a handkerchief to her eyes  and her face was tearful\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is dreadful, dreadful! she was saying, but cost me what it  may I shall do my duty\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will come and spend the night\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cant think why his nieces  put it off\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Adieu, ma bonne, answered Prince Vasli turning away from her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, he is in a dreadful state, said the mother to her son when  they were in the carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont understand, Mammawhat is his attitude to Pierre?  asked the son\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it\"\n",
      "null\t\" But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, Heaven! How ill he is! exclaimed the mother\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XVII\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is the matter with you, my dear? she said crossly to the maid  who kept her waiting some minutes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you wish to serve me? Then  Ill find you another place\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess was upset by her friends sorrow and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her  with exaggerated politeness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I am very sorry, maam, answered the maid\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ask the count to come to me\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as  usual\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, little countess? What a saut of game au madre we are to  have, my dear! I tasted it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The thousand rubles I paid for Tars were  not ill-spent\"\n",
      "null\t\" He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling  his gray hair\"\n",
      "null\t\" What are your commands, little countess?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats that mess? she said, pointing to his  waistcoat\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its the saut, most likely, she added with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Her face became sad\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, little countess! \"\n",
      "null\t\" and the count began bustling to get out  his pocketbook\"\n",
      "null\t\" I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles, and taking  out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husbands waistcoat\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, whos there? he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will  rush to obey the summons\"\n",
      "null\t\" Send Dmtri to me!\"\n",
      "null\t\" This is what I want, my dear fellow, said the count to the  deferential young man who had entered\"\n",
      "null\t\" he reflected a moment, yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, dont bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones  for the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, Dmtri, clean ones, please, said the countess, sighing  deeply\"\n",
      "null\t\"  When would you like them, your excellency? asked Dmtri\"\n",
      "null\t\" Allow  me to inform you\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, dont be uneasy, he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always  a sign of approaching anger\"\n",
      "null\t\" I was forgetting\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a treasure that Dmtri is, added the count with a smile when  the young man had departed\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is never any impossible with  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats a thing I hate! Everything is possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift, said the  count, and having kissed his wifes hand he went back to his study\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Anna Mikhylovna returned from Count Bezkhovs the money, all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess little table, and Anna Mikhylovna noticed that something was agitating  her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, my dear? asked the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so  ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word\"\n",
      "null\t\" Annette, for heavens sake dont refuse me, the countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,  elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be  ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment\"\n",
      "null\t\"  This is for Bors from me, for his outfit\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anna Mikhylovna was already embracing her and weeping\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess  wept too\"\n",
      "null\t\" They wept because they were friends, and because they were kindhearted, and because theyfriends from childhoodhad to think  about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But those tears were pleasant to them both\"\n",
      "null\t\" Countess Rostva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was  already seated in the drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count took the gentlemen into  his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes\"\n",
      "null\t\" From time to time he went out to ask: Hasnt she come yet? They were expecting Mrya Dmtrievna Akhrosmova, known in society as le terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for  common sense and frank plainness of speech\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mrya Dmtrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less all without exception  respected and feared her\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the counts room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the  recruiting\"\n",
      "null\t\" None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew  it had appeared\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were  smoking and talking\"\n",
      "null\t\" He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he  egged on against each other\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable  young man\"\n",
      "null\t\" He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the  smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was an old bachelor, Shinshn, a cousin of the countess, a man with a sharp tongue  as they said in Moscow society\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seemed to be condescending to  his companion\"\n",
      "null\t\" The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting  it escape from his handsome mouth in rings\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semnov regiment with whom Bors was to travel to join the army, and about whom Natsha had teased her elder sister Vra,  speaking of Berg as her intended\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count sat between them and  listened attentively\"\n",
      "null\t\" His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he  succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, then, old chap, mon trs honorable Alphonse Krlovich, said Shinshn, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phraseswhich was a peculiarity  of his speech\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur ltat; * you want to make something out of your company?\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, Peter Nikolevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry  the advantages are far less than in the infantry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just consider my own  position now, Peter Nikolevich\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision\"\n",
      "null\t\" His conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing  on himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk  circumstantially and with evident satisfaction\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Consider my position, Peter Nikolevich\"\n",
      "null\t\" Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty, said he, looking at Shinshn and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must  always be the chief desire of everyone else\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides that, Peter Nikolevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position, continued Berg, and  vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father, he went on,  emitting a smoke ring\"\n",
      "null\t\"  La balance y est\"\n",
      "null\t\" * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the proverb says, remarked Shinshn, moving his pipe to the other side  of his mouth and winking at the count\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * So that squares matters\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The count burst out laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" The other guests seeing that Shinshn  was talking came up to listen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in  the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,  too, might have their own interests\"\n",
      "null\t\" But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the navet of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that  he disarmed his hearers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, my boy, youll get along wherever you gofoot or horsethat Ill warrant, said Shinshn, patting him on the  shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Berg smiled joyously\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count, followed by his guests, went into the  drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests, expecting the summons to zakska, * avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order  to show that they are not at all impatient for their food\"\n",
      "null\t\" The host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are waiting forsome important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish  that is not yet ready\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * Hors doeuvres\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,  blocking the way for everyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on navely looking around through his spectacles as if in  search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact\"\n",
      "null\t\" Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest  fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You have only lately arrived? the countess asked him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oui, madame, replied he, looking around him\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have not yet seen my husband?\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose its very  interesting\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very interesting\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he  answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables\"\n",
      "null\t\" The other  guests were all conversing with one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Razumvskis\"\n",
      "null\t\" was heard  on all sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess rose and went into the ballroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" Herself, came the answer in a rough voice, and Mrya Dmtrievna  entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very  oldest rose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tall and stout, holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if  rolling them up\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mrya Dmtrievna always spoke in Russian\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, you old sinner, she went on, turning to the count who was kissing her hand, youre feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just  see how these nestlings are growing up, and she pointed to the girls\"\n",
      "null\t\" You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, said she, hows my Cossack? (Mrya Dmtrievna always called Natsha a Cossack) and she stroked the childs arm as  she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know shes a scamp  of a girl, but I like her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natsha, who beamed with the pleasure of her saints-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to  Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit, said she, assuming a soft high  tone of voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" and she ominously tucked  up her sleeves still higher\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre approached, looking at her in a  childlike way through his spectacles\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case its my  evident duty\"\n",
      "null\t\" She paused\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!\"\n",
      "null\t\" His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,  sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war\"\n",
      "null\t\" She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep  from laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, I suppose it is time we were at table? said Mrya  Dmtrievna\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count went in first with Mrya Dmtrievna, the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikhylovna  with Shinshn\"\n",
      "null\t\" The smiling Julie Kargina  went in with Nicholas\"\n",
      "null\t\" After them other couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses  followed singly\"\n",
      "null\t\" The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their  places\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then the strains of the counts household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the  soft steps of the footmen\"\n",
      "null\t\" At one end of the table sat the countess with Mrya Dmtrievna on her right and Anna Mikhylovna on her left, the  other lady visitors were farther down\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshn and the other male  visitors on his right\"\n",
      "null\t\" Midway down the long table on one side sat the grown-up young people: Vra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Bors; and  on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses\"\n",
      "null\t\" From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled  his neighbors glasses, not neglecting his own\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed  by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the mens end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so  much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg with tender smiles was saying to Vra that love is not an earthly but  a heavenly feeling\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Natsha, who was sitting  opposite\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a  great deal\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and  went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines\"\n",
      "null\t\" These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the next mans shoulders and whispered: Dry  Madeira\"\n",
      "null\t\" or Rhine wine as the case might  be\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the counts monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other  guests\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, who sat opposite, was looking at Bors as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for  the first time\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girls look made him inclined to laugh without knowing  why\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas sat at some distance from Snya, beside Julie Kargina, to  whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas  and Julie were saying to one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the  children\"\n",
      "null\t\" The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler  with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by\"\n",
      "null\t\" He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for  knowledge\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XIX\"\n",
      "null\t\" The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day  been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte? remarked  Shinshn\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has stopped Austrias cackle and I fear it will be  our turn next\"\n",
      "null\t\" The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to  the service and patriotically Russian\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is for the reasson, my goot sir, said he, speaking with a  German accent, for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat\"\n",
      "null\t\" He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell  as ze sanctity of its alliances\"\n",
      "null\t\" he spoke this last word with  particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:\"\n",
      "null\t\" and the wish, which constitutes the Emperors sole and absolute aimto establish peace in Europe on firm foundationshas now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition  for the attainment of that purpose\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Zat, my dear sir, is vy\"\n",
      "null\t\" he concluded, drinking a tumbler of  wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval\"\n",
      "null\t\" Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn spindles at home!? said Shinshn, puckering his brows and  smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\"*(2) Suvrov nowhe knew what he was about; yet they beat him plate couture,*(3) and where are we to find Suvrovs now? Je vous demande un peu, *(4) said he,  continually changing from French to Russian\"\n",
      "null\t\" *Do you know the proverb?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  *(3) Hollow\"\n",
      "null\t\"  *(4) I just ask you that\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood! said the colonel, thumping the table; and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill  pe vell\"\n",
      "null\t\" he dwelt  particularly on the word possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" as po-o-ossible, he ended,  again turning to the count\"\n",
      "null\t\" Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zeres an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it? he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with  eyes and ears intent on the colonel\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am quite of your opinion, replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great  danger\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer, he concluded, consciousas were othersafter the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and  were therefore awkward\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What you said just now was splendid! said his partner Julie\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and  down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre listened to the colonels speech and nodded approvingly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats fine, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" The young mans a real hussar! shouted the colonel, again  thumping the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" What are you making such a noise about over there? Mrya Dmtrievnas deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the  table\"\n",
      "null\t\" What are you thumping the table for? she demanded of the hussar, and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its all about the war, the count shouted down the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" You  know my sons going, Mrya Dmtrievna? My son is going\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I have four sons in the army but still I dont fret\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is all  in Gods hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle, replied Mrya Dmtrievnas deep voice, which easily  carried the whole length of the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats true!\"\n",
      "null\t\" You wont ask, Natshas little brother was saying; I know you wont ask!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution\"\n",
      "null\t\" She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother:\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is it? asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughters face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her  sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The conversation was hushed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mamma! What sweets are we going to have? and Natshas voice  sounded still more firm and resolute\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The countess tried to frown, but could not\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mrya Dmtrievna shook her  fat finger\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Cossack! she said threateningly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the  elders\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You had better take care! said the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mamma! What sweets are we going to have? Natsha again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in  good part\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Snya and fat little Ptya doubled up with laughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" You see! I have asked, whispered Natsha to her little brother  and to Pierre, glancing at him again\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ice pudding, but you wont get any, said Mrya Dmtrievna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even  Mrya Dmtrievna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mrya Dmtrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I dont like ice  cream\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Carrot ices\"\n",
      "null\t\" No! What kind, Mrya Dmtrievna? What kind? she almost screamed; I want to know!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone laughed, not at Mrya Dmtrievnas answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had  dared to treat Mrya Dmtrievna in this fashion\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha only desisted when she had been told that there would be  pineapple ice\"\n",
      "null\t\" The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, went up to congratulate the countess, and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and  with one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the  guests returned to the drawing room and to the counts study\"\n",
      "null\t\" The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the counts visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,  some in the sitting room, some in the library\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from  dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" The young people, at the countess instigation, gathered round the  clavichord and harp\"\n",
      "null\t\" Julie by general request played first\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the  same time felt shy\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What shall we sing? she said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Brook, suggested Nicholas\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, then, lets be quick\"\n",
      "null\t\" She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to  look for her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Running into Snyas room and not finding her there, Natsha ran to  the nursery, but Snya was not there either\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha concluded that  she must be on the chest in the passage\"\n",
      "null\t\" The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostv  household\"\n",
      "null\t\" And there in fact was Snya lying face downward on Nurses dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing  so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natshas face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saints day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad  neck and the corners of her mouth drooped\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Snya! What is it? What is the matter?\"\n",
      "null\t\"! And Natshas large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Snya was  crying\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and  hid her face still deeper in the bed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha wept, sitting on the  blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" With an effort Snya  sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Nicholas is going away in a weeks time, his\"\n",
      "null\t\" papers\"\n",
      "null\t\" he told me himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" no one can  understand\"\n",
      "null\t\" what a soul he has!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its all very well for you\"\n",
      "null\t\" I love you and  Bors also, she went on, gaining a little strength; he is nice\"\n",
      "null\t\"  there are no difficulties in your way\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Nicholas is my cousin\"\n",
      "null\t\" the Metropolitan himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" And besides, if she tells Mamma (Snya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so) that I am spoiling  Nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly\"\n",
      "null\t\" God is my witness, and she made the sign of the cross, I love her so  much, and all of you, only Vra\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice  everything, only I have nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in  the feather bed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha began consoling her, but her face showed that  she understood all the gravity of her friends trouble\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and she found them on my table and said shed show them to Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry  me, but that hell marry Julie\"\n",
      "null\t\" You see how hes been with her all  day\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, what have I done to deserve it?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting  her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya, dont believe her, darling! Dont believe her! Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting  room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont quite remember how, but dont you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? Theres Uncle Shinshns brother  has married his first cousin\"\n",
      "null\t\" And we are only second cousins, you know\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know I have told him all about  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you cry, Snya, dear love, darling Snya! and she kissed her and  laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vras spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right  and she wont say anything to Mamma\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas will tell her himself,  and he doesnt care at all for Julie\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Natsha kissed her on the hair\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Snya sat up\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin  playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Do you think so?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Really? Truly? she said, quickly smoothing her  frock and hair\"\n",
      "null\t\" Really, truly! answered Natsha, pushing in a crisp lock that had  strayed from under her friends plaits\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Both laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, lets go and sing The Brook\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny! said  Natsha, stopping suddenly\"\n",
      "null\t\" I feel so happy!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after Natsha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face  and light, joyous steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the visitors request the young people  sang the quartette, The Brook, with which everyone was delighted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:\"\n",
      "null\t\" A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,  But oh! till then I cannot live!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the  coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshn had engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in  which several others joined but which bored Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the music began Natsha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and blushing:\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am afraid of mixing the figures, Pierre replied; but if you  will be my teacher\"\n",
      "null\t\" And lowering his big arm he offered it to the  slender little girl\"\n",
      "null\t\" While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,  Pierre sat down with his little partner\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha was perfectly happy;  she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was  sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady\"\n",
      "null\t\" She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold\"\n",
      "null\t\" Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and  smiling over the fan\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dear, dear! Just look at her! exclaimed the countess as she  crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natsha\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Natsha blushed and laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?\"\n",
      "null\t\" They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long,  and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" First  came Mrya Dmtrievna and the count, both with merry countenances\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his  bent arm to Mrya Dmtrievna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Semn! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?\"\n",
      "null\t\" (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise\"\n",
      "null\t\")\"\n",
      "null\t\" And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, Mrya Dmtrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the  onlookers for what was to follow\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfsthe men on one side and the women on the otherwho with beaming faces had come to see their master making  merry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is! loudly remarked  the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The count danced well and knew it\"\n",
      "null\t\" But his partner could not and did not  want to dance well\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her  stern but handsome face really joined in the dance\"\n",
      "null\t\" What was expressed by the whole of the counts plump figure, in Mrya Dmtrievna found  expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose\"\n",
      "null\t\" But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Mrya Dmtrievna produced no less impression by slight exertionsthe least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her footwhich everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual  severity\"\n",
      "null\t\" The other couples could not attract a moments attention to their own evolutions and did not  even try to do so\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to look at Papa! though as it was they never took their eyes off the  couple\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved  and shouted to the musicians to play faster\"\n",
      "null\t\" Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round Mrya Dmtrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and  laughter led by Natsha\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both partners stood still, breathing heavily  and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats how we used to dance in our time, ma chre, said the  count\"\n",
      "null\t\" That was a Daniel Cooper! exclaimed Mrya Dmtrievna, tucking up  her sleeves and puffing heavily\"\n",
      "null\t\" While in the Rostvs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezkhov had a  sixth stroke\"\n",
      "null\t\" The doctors pronounced recovery impossible\"\n",
      "null\t\" Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up,  waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the counts health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of  Catherines court, Count Bezkhov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The magnificent reception room was crowded\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed  on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in  low tones\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasli sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other,  leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading  to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying mans room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at  his door, which creaked slightly when opened\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The limits of human life \"\n",
      "null\t\" are fixed and may not be oerpassed, said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat  beside him and was listening navely to his words\"\n",
      "null\t\" I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction? asked the lady, adding the priests clerical title, as if she had no opinion of  her own on the subject\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament, replied the priest, passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his  bald head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who was that? The Military Governor himself? was being asked at  the other side of the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" How young-looking he is!\"\n",
      "null\t\" I hear the count no longer recognizes  anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" They wished to administer the sacrament of unction\"\n",
      "null\t\" The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red  from weeping and sat down beside Dr\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a  table\"\n",
      "null\t\" Beautiful, said the doctor in answer to a remark about the  weather\"\n",
      "null\t\" The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow  one feels as if one were in the country\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, indeed, replied the princess with a sigh\"\n",
      "null\t\" So he may have something to drink?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Has he taken his medicine?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The doctor glanced at his watch\"\n",
      "null\t\" Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,  and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dere has neffer been a gase, a German doctor was saying to an  aide-de-camp, dat one liffs after de sird stroke\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And what a well-preserved man he was! remarked the aide-de-camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" And who will inherit his wealth? he added in a whisper\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It vont go begging, replied the German with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to  Lorrains instructions\"\n",
      "null\t\" The German doctor went up to Lorrain\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before  his nose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tonight, not later, said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to  understand and state the patients condition\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Meanwhile Prince Vasli had opened the door into the princess room\"\n",
      "null\t\" In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before  the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles\"\n",
      "null\t\" The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,  cupboards, and little tables\"\n",
      "null\t\" The quilt of a high, white feather bed was  just visible behind a screen\"\n",
      "null\t\" She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with  varnish\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Has anything happened? she asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am so terrified\"\n",
      "null\t\" I only came to have a talk about business, Catiche, * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair  she had just vacated\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have made the place warm, I must say, he  remarked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, sit down: lets have a talk\"\n",
      "null\t\" I thought perhaps something had happened, she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the  prince, she prepared to listen\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I cant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, my dear? said Prince Vasli, taking her hand and bending it  downwards as was his habit\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was plain that this well? referred to much that they both  understood without naming\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasli with no sign of emotion in her  prominent gray eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons  with a sigh\"\n",
      "null\t\" This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow  and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince  Vasli understood it as an expression of weariness\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I? he said; do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a  very serious talk\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant  expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" His eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the  next glanced round in alarm\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked attentively into Prince Vaslis eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till  morning\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semnovna, continued Prince Vasli, returning to his theme, apparently not without an inner struggle; at such a moment as this one must think  of everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" One must think of the future, of all of you\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same  dull expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" And then of course my family has also to be considered, Prince Vasli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at  her\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, Catiche, that weyou three sisters, Mmontov, and  my wifeare the counts only direct heirs\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know, I know how hard  it is for you to talk or think of such matters\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for  anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count, pointing to  his portrait, definitely demanded that he should be called\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was  simply looking at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin, she replied, and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow  his noble soul peacefully to leave this\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, yes, of course, interrupted Prince Vasli impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little  table that he had pushed away\"\n",
      "null\t\" you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left  all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He has made wills enough! quietly remarked the princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" But he  cannot leave the estate to Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre is illegitimate\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the  subject under discussion than those they are talking with\"\n",
      "null\t\" I can tell you more, continued Prince Vasli, seizing her hand, that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew  of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is over, and Prince Vasli sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over, and the counts papers are opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition  will certainly be granted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre will get everything as the legitimate  son\"\n",
      "null\t\" And our share? asked the princess smiling ironically, as if  anything might happen, only not that\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the  legal heir to everything and you wont get anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" You must know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have  been destroyed or not\"\n",
      "null\t\" And if they have somehow been overlooked, you  ought to know where they are, and must find them, because\"\n",
      "null\t\" What next? the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not  changing the expression of her eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am a woman, and you think we  are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit\"\n",
      "null\t\" un btard!* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasli the invalidity of his  contention\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * A bastard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, really, Catiche! Cant you understand! You are so intelligent, how is it you dont see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezkhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation  of having been dutiful et tout ce qui sensuit!* Thats certain\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * And all that follows therefrom\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool, said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are  saying something witty and stinging\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear Princess Catherine Semnovna, began Prince Vasli impatiently, I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about  your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierres favor are among the counts papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you dont believe me,  then believe an expert\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have just been talking to Dmtri Onfrich  (the family solicitor) and he says the same\"\n",
      "null\t\" At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas; her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself  evidently did not expect\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That would be a fine thing! said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" I never wanted anything  and I dont now\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress\"\n",
      "null\t\" And this is gratitudethis is recognition for those who have  sacrificed everything for his sake! she cried\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its splendid!  Fine! I dont want anything, Prince\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, but you are not the only one\"\n",
      "null\t\" There are your sisters\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But the princess did not listen to him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten\"\n",
      "null\t\" I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitudethe  blackest ingratitudein this house\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you or do you not know where that will is? insisted Prince  Vasli, his cheeks twitching more than ever\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and  sacrificed myself\"\n",
      "null\t\" But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has been intriguing!\"\n",
      "null\t\" She  had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race\"\n",
      "null\t\" She gave her companion an angry glance\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There is still time, my dear\"\n",
      "null\t\" You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards  forgotten\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let  him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who sacrificed everything for him, chimed in the princess, who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, though  he never could appreciate it\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, mon cousin, she added with a sigh, I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward,  that in this world there is neither honor nor justice\"\n",
      "null\t\" In this world one  has to be cunning and cruel\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Now come, come! Be reasonable\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know your excellent heart\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I know your heart, repeated the prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" I value your friendship  and wish you to have as good an opinion of me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it  but an hour\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where  it is\"\n",
      "null\t\" You must know\"\n",
      "null\t\" You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his  wishes; that is my only reason for being here\"\n",
      "null\t\" I came simply to help him  and you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguingI know! cried  the princess\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats not the point, my dear\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its that protg of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskya,  that Anna Mikhylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid\"\n",
      "null\t\" the infamous, vile woman!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, dont talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about SophieI cant repeat themthat it made the count quite ill and he  would not see us for a whole fortnight\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know it was then he wrote this  vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weve got to it at lastwhy did you not tell me about it sooner?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman! almost shrieked  the princess, now quite changed\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what does she come worming  herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikhylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was  driving into the court of Count Bezkhovs house\"\n",
      "null\t\" As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikhylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that  he was asleep in his corner and woke him up\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikhylovna out of the carriage, and only then began  to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back  door\"\n",
      "null\t\" While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the  shadow of the wall\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other  men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" But neither Anna Mikhylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who  could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seems  to be all right, Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to  Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikhylovnas air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely  necessary\"\n",
      "null\t\" Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots  clattering\"\n",
      "null\t\" These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them  there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is this the way to the princesses apartments? asked Anna  Mikhylovna of one of them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were  now permissible; the door to the left, maam\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps the count did not ask for me, said Pierre when he reached  the landing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Id better go to my own room\"\n",
      "null\t\" But really, hadnt I better go away? he asked, looking kindly at  her over his spectacles\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Think that he is your father \"\n",
      "null\t\" perhaps in the agony of death\"\n",
      "null\t\" Trust yourself to  me, Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikhylovna who was  already opening a door\"\n",
      "null\t\"  This door led into a back anteroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" An old man, a servant of the  princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of  these rooms\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet, asked  about the princess health and then led Pierre along a stone passage\"\n",
      "null\t\" The first door on the left led into the princesses apartments\"\n",
      "null\t\" The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikhylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasli and the eldest princess were sitting close together  talking\"\n",
      "null\t\" Seeing them pass, Prince Vasli drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of  desperation slammed the door with all her might\"\n",
      "null\t\" This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince Vaslis face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre  stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as  if to say that this was no more than she had expected\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Be a man, my friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will look after your interests, said she in  reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what watching over his interests meant, but he decided that all these  things had to be\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the passage they went into a large, dimly  lit room adjoining the counts reception room\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water  had been spilled on the carpet\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were met by a deacon with a censer  and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them\"\n",
      "null\t\" They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full  length portrait of Catherine the Great\"\n",
      "null\t\" The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one  another\"\n",
      "null\t\" All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikhylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who,  hanging his head, meekly followed her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisive  moment had arrived\"\n",
      "null\t\" With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than  that afternoon\"\n",
      "null\t\" She felt that as she brought with her the person the  dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured\"\n",
      "null\t\" Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing  first of one and then of another priest\"\n",
      "null\t\" God be thanked that you are in time, said she to one of the  priests; all we relatives have been in such anxiety\"\n",
      "null\t\" This young  man is the counts son, she added more softly\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a terrible moment!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dear doctor, said she, this young man is the counts son\"\n",
      "null\t\" The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his  shoulders\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away  from the doctor to Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Trust in His mercy! and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was  watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved  toward the sofa she had indicated\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as Anna Mikhylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him  with something more than curiosity and sympathy\"\n",
      "null\t\" He noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind  of awe and even servility\"\n",
      "null\t\" A deference such as he had never before  received was shown him\"\n",
      "null\t\" A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully  silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him\"\n",
      "null\t\" At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound  to accept their services\"\n",
      "null\t\" He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the ladys chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the nave attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of  those who were guiding him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasli with head erect  majestically entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was wearing his long coat with three  stars on his breast\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed  Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly  fixed on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is  well! and he turned to go\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: How is\"\n",
      "null\t\" and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the  count, yet ashamed to call him father\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He had another stroke about half an hour ago\"\n",
      "null\t\" Courage, my  friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierres mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke  suggested to him a blow from something\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked at Prince Vasli in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of  illness\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli said something to Lorrain in passing and went  through the door on tiptoe\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could not walk well on tiptoe and his  whole body jerked at each step\"\n",
      "null\t\" The eldest princess followed him, and  the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last Anna Mikhylovna, still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to  enter that room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its  walls hung round with Persian carpets\"\n",
      "null\t\" The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated  with red light like a Russian church during evening service\"\n",
      "null\t\" Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre sawcovered to the waist by a bright green quiltthe familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezkhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep  characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face\"\n",
      "null\t\" He lay  just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt\"\n",
      "null\t\" Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from  behind the chair, held it in position\"\n",
      "null\t\" By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the  service\"\n",
      "null\t\" A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for  herself should she glance round\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door  near the strange lady\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward  each time he touched his forehead\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face wore a calm look of piety  and resignation to the will of God\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you do not understand these sentiments, he seemed to be saying, so much the worse for you!\"\n",
      "null\t\" All were silently crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of  feet were the only sounds that could be heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave  him a taper\"\n",
      "null\t\" He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him,  began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,  watched him\"\n",
      "null\t\" She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she  again began to laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of  temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the counts hand  got up and said something to the ladies\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from  behind her back\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full  importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected  a moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service  continued\"\n",
      "null\t\" During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasli left the chair on which he had been leaning, andwith an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for themdid not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its  silken hangings\"\n",
      "null\t\" On leaving the bed both Prince Vasli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the  other before the service was concluded\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was  in some way essential\"\n",
      "null\t\" The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the  sacrament\"\n",
      "null\t\" The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre heard her say:\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray manewhich, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight  of for a single moment during the whole service\"\n",
      "null\t\" He judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that  they had lifted the dying man and were moving him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Catch hold of my arm or youll drop him! he heard one of the  servants say in a frightened whisper\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here! exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the  weight they were carrying were too much for them\"\n",
      "null\t\" As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhylovna, passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying mans high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,  leonine head\"\n",
      "null\t\" This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was  not disfigured by the approach of death\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to  Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\" But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon  nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" After a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had  carried the sick man dispersed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna touched Pierres  hand and said, Come\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony  just completed\"\n",
      "null\t\" His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms  downward\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal  man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes  they must look somewhere, or it meant too much\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre hesitated,  not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick  mans hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her  suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Neither  the hand nor a single muscle of the counts face stirred\"\n",
      "null\t\" Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikhylovna to see what he was to  do next\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood  beside the bed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were  doing right\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna nodded approvingly\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierres face had been before he sat  down\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the  father and son\"\n",
      "null\t\" This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an  hour\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the counts face began  to twitch\"\n",
      "null\t\" The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and  from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna looked attentively at the sick mans eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the  quilt\"\n",
      "null\t\" The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wants to turn on the other side, whispered the servant, and got up  to turn the counts heavy body toward the wall\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre rose to help him\"\n",
      "null\t\" While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back  helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierres terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride  his own helplessness\"\n",
      "null\t\" At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his  eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is dozing, said Anna Mikhylovna, observing that one of the  princesses was coming to take her turn at watching\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let us go\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasli and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the  Great and talking eagerly\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room, said Prince  Vasli to Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go and take something, my poor Anna  Mikhylovna, or you will not hold out\"\n",
      "null\t\" To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze  below the shoulder\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre went with Anna Mikhylovna into the small  drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea, Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid  in the small circular room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Around the table all who were at Count  Bezkhovs house that night had gathered to fortify themselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors  and little tables\"\n",
      "null\t\" During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly  lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now  this same room was dimly lighted by two candles\"\n",
      "null\t\" On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the  bedroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have  liked to\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince  Vasli and the eldest princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre concluded that this also was  essential, and after a short interval followed her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited  whispers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not necessary, said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the  same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, my dear princess, answered Anna Mikhylovna blandly but impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing, wont this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is  already prepared\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude,  with one leg crossed high above the other\"\n",
      "null\t\" His cheeks, which were so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were  saying\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Come, my dear Anna Mikhylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases\"\n",
      "null\t\" You  know how fond the count is of her\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont even know what is in this paper, said the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasli and pointing to an inlaid  portfolio she held in her hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" All I know is that his real will is  in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten\"\n",
      "null\t\" She tried to pass Anna Mikhylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar  her path\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know, my dear, kind princess, said Anna Mikhylovna, seizing  the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous  en conjure\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess did not reply\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna  Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none  of its honeyed firmness and softness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre, my dear, come here\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why dont you speak, cousin? suddenly shrieked the princess so  loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying mans room? Intriguer! she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the  portfolio\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Anna Mikhylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the  portfolio, and changed her grip\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli rose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh! said he with reproach and surprise,  this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess let go\"\n",
      "null\t\" And you too!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility\"\n",
      "null\t\" I myself will go  and ask him, I!\"\n",
      "null\t\" does that satisfy you?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Remember that you will answer for the consequences, said Prince  Vasli severely\"\n",
      "null\t\" You dont know what you are doing\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli bent his head and spread out his hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out  wringing her hands\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What are you doing! she cried vehemently\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is dying and you leave me alone with him!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, stooping, quickly  caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" The eldest  princess and Prince Vasli, recovering themselves, followed her\"\n",
      "null\t\" A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again  biting her underlip\"\n",
      "null\t\" At sight of Pierre her expression showed an  irrepressible hatred\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, now you may be glad! said she; this is what you have  been waiting for\"\n",
      "null\t\" And bursting into tears she hid her face in her  handkerchief and rushed from the room\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli came next\"\n",
      "null\t\" He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was  sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an  ague\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my friend! said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it  before\"\n",
      "null\t\" How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am  near sixty, dear friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" I too\"\n",
      "null\t\" and he burst into tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" She approached Pierre with slow, quiet  steps\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre! she said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre gave her an inquiring look\"\n",
      "null\t\" She kissed the young man on his  forehead, wetting him with her tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then after a pause she said:\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre looked at her over his spectacles\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Come, I will go with you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as  tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could  see his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna left him, and when she returned he was  fast asleep with his head on his arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the morning Anna Mikhylovna said to Pierre:\"\n",
      "null\t\" But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command  of an immense fortune\"\n",
      "null\t\" The will has not yet been opened\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pierre was silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised  me only the day before yesterday not to forget Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" But he had  no time\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in  silence at Princess Anna Mikhylovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" After her talk with Pierre, Anna  Mikhylovna returned to the Rostvs and went to bed\"\n",
      "null\t\" On waking in the morning she told the Rostvs and all her acquaintances the details  of Count Bezkhovs death\"\n",
      "null\t\" She said the count had died as she would  herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying\"\n",
      "null\t\" As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those awful momentsthe father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his  dying father\"\n",
      "null\t\" It uplifts the  soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son, said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasli she spoke  disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XXV\"\n",
      "null\t\" General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andrevich (nicknamed in society, the King of Prussia) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle  Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to  Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" He used to say that there are only two sources of human viceidleness and  superstition, and only two virtuesactivity and intelligence\"\n",
      "null\t\" He himself undertook his daughters education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was  occupied\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on  at his estate\"\n",
      "null\t\" As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of  exactitude\"\n",
      "null\t\" He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,  and not only at the same hour but at the same minute\"\n",
      "null\t\" With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear  and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused\"\n",
      "null\t\" Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the princes estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince  appeared punctually to the appointed hour\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,  youthfully glittering eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a  silent prayer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every morning she came in like that, and every morning  prayed that the daily interview might pass off well\"\n",
      "null\t\" An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose  quietly and said in a whisper: Please walk in\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess timidly  opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily\"\n",
      "null\t\" She paused at the  entrance\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round  continued his work\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use\"\n",
      "null\t\" The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundall indicated  continuous, varied, and orderly activity\"\n",
      "null\t\" The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the  tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age\"\n",
      "null\t\" After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching  the table, summoned his daughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" He never gave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively, said severely:\"\n",
      "null\t\" He took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair  with his foot\"\n",
      "null\t\" For tomorrow! said he, quickly finding the page and making a  scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess bent over the exercise book on the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wait a bit, heres a letter for you, said the old man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in a womans hand from a bag hanging above  the table, onto which he threw it\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the  princess face\"\n",
      "null\t\" She took it quickly and bent her head over it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, its from Julie, replied the princess with a timid glance  and a timid smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill let two more letters pass, but the third Ill read, said  the prince sternly; Im afraid you write much nonsense\"\n",
      "null\t\" Read this if you like, Father, said the princess, blushing still  more and holding out the letter\"\n",
      "null\t\" The third, I said the third! cried the prince abruptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him  the exercise book containing geometrical figures\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, madam, he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of  old age and tobacco, which she had known so long\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now, madam, these  triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess looked in a scared way at her fathers eyes glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her fathers further  explanations, however clear they might be\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether it was the teachers fault or the pupils, this same thing happened every day: the princess eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern fathers withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in  peace\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded,  and sometimes flung the exercise book away\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The princess gave a wrong answer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well now, isnt she a fool! shouted the prince, pushing the book aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and  down, lightly touched his daughters hair and sat down again\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He drew up his chair, and continued to explain\"\n",
      "null\t\" This wont do, Princess; it wont do, said he, when Princess Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next days lesson, was about to leave: Mathematics are most important, madam!  I dont want to have you like our silly ladies\"\n",
      "null\t\" Get used to it and  youll like it, and he patted her cheek\"\n",
      "null\t\" It will drive all the  nonsense out of your head\"\n",
      "null\t\" She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut  book from the high desk\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Hlose has  sent you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Religious! I dont interfere with anyones belief\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, now go\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that  rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer\"\n",
      "null\t\" She sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and  which was littered with books and papers\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess was as untidy as  her father was tidy\"\n",
      "null\t\" She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke  the seal of her letter\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was from her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Kargina who had been at the Rostvs  name-day party\"\n",
      "null\t\" Julie wrote in French:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?\"\n",
      "null\t\" It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and  thin face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness  at her reflection in the glass\"\n",
      "null\t\" She flatters me, thought the  princess, turning away and continuing to read\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Julie did not flatter her friend, the princess eyeslarge, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face  they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyesthe look  they had when she was not thinking of herself\"\n",
      "null\t\" As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a  glass\"\n",
      "null\t\" She went on reading:\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of my two brothers is already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march  to the frontier\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought  intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war\"\n",
      "null\t\" God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this  war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart\"\n",
      "null\t\" I mean young Nicholas Rostv, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain  inactive and has left the university to join the army\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for  the army was a great grief to me\"\n",
      "null\t\" This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,  he is so frank and has so much heart\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the  sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much\"\n",
      "null\t\" Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is still too fresh\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know  these poignant joys and sorrows\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,  this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed\"\n",
      "null\t\" But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of  old Count Bezkhov, and his inheritance\"\n",
      "null\t\" Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vasli nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezkhov and  possessor of the finest fortune in Russia\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is rumored that Prince Vasli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he  returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen\"\n",
      "null\t\" I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort  of fellow\"\n",
      "null\t\" As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I dont even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess  Bezkhova\"\n",
      "null\t\" propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikhylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of  a plan of marriage for you\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vaslis son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distingue, and it is on you that his relations  choice has fallen\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont know what you will think of it, but  I consider it my duty to let you know of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is said to be very  handsome and a terrible scapegrace\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is all I have been able to find  out about him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But enough of gossip\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and  Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Aprksins\"\n",
      "null\t\" Read the  mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it  is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul\"\n",
      "null\t\" Adieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle  Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\" JULIE\"\n",
      "null\t\"S\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then she suddenly  rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" She took a sheet of  paper and her hand moved rapidly over it\"\n",
      "null\t\" This is the reply she wrote, also in French:\"\n",
      "null\t\" So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect  on you\"\n",
      "null\t\" You complain of our separation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young  man? On such matters I am only severe with myself\"\n",
      "null\t\" I understand such feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of  them, neither do I condemn them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only it seems to me that Christian love, love of ones neighbor, love of ones enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a  young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself\"\n",
      "null\t\" The news of Count Bezkhovs death reached us before your letter  and my father was much affected by it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He says the count was the last representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as  possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value  most in people\"\n",
      "null\t\" As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince  Vasli, it is very sad for both\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviours words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are  terribly true\"\n",
      "null\t\" So young, and burdened with such richesto what temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be  poorer than the poorest beggar\"\n",
      "null\t\" A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the  volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear  no fruit\"\n",
      "null\t\" I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for  exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let us rather read  the Epistles and Gospels\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our  divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will  He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit\"\n",
      "null\t\" My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he  has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must  conform\"\n",
      "null\t\" However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings  toward him whom He may give me for husband\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival  at Bald Hills with his wife\"\n",
      "null\t\" This pleasure will be but a brief one, however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war  into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not only where you areat the heart of affairs and of the worldis the talk all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of naturewhich townsfolk consider characteristic of the countryrumors of war are heard  and painfully felt\"\n",
      "null\t\" My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a  heartrending scene\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our  people and starting to join the army\"\n",
      "null\t\" You should have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should  have heard the sobs\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of injuriesand that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing  one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" MARY\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have written to my poor mother, said the smiling Mademoiselle  Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rs\"\n",
      "null\t\" She brought into Princess Marys strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and  self-satisfied\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess, I must warn you, she added, lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement, the prince has been scolding Michael  Ivnovich\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is in a very bad humor, very morose\"\n",
      "null\t\" I do not allow myself to judge  him and would not have others do so\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting  room with a look of alarm\"\n",
      "null\t\" Between twelve and two oclock, as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the  clavichord\"\n",
      "null\t\" The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of  the prince, who was in his large study\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passagestwenty  times repeatedof a sonata by Dussek\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the  porch\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to  alight, and let her pass into the house before him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Old Tkhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in  a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tkhon knew that neither the sons arrival nor any other unusual  event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tkhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his fathers habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he  turned to his wife\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He will get up in twenty minutes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let us go across to Marys  room, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as  merrily and prettily as ever\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, this is a palace! she said to her husband, looking around  with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lets come, quick, quick! And with a glance round, she smiled at  Tkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is that Mary practicing? Lets go quietly and take her by  surprise\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youve grown older, Tkhon, he said in passing to the old man,  who kissed his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,  rushed out apparently beside herself with delight\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah! what joy for the princess! exclaimed she: At last! I must  let her know\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, no, please not\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are Mademoiselle Bourienne, said  the little princess, kissing her\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know you already through my  sister-in-laws friendship for you\"\n",
      "null\t\" They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound  of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew stopped and  made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The little princess entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The passage broke off in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Marys heavy tread and the  sound of kissing\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each others arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they  happened to touch\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to  cry or to laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as  lovers of music do when they hear a false note\"\n",
      "null\t\" The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each others hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrews surprise  both began to cry and kissed again\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to  cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never  entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah! my dear!\"\n",
      "null\t\" they suddenly exclaimed, and then  laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\"You were not expecting  us?\"\n",
      "null\t\" And you have grown  stouter!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I knew the princess at once, put in Mademoiselle Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And I had no idea!\"\n",
      "null\t\" exclaimed Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and  he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,  rested on Prince Andrews face\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of  glittering teeth and sparkling eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" She told of an accident they had had on the Spsski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary,  a real one, but that they would talk of that later\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full  of love and sadness\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was plain that she was following a train of  thought independent of her sister-in-laws words\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Lise sighed too\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, and even tomorrow, replied her brother\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had  promotion\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of  thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Is it certain? she said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The face of the little princess changed\"\n",
      "null\t\" She sighed and said: Yes,  quite certain\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah! it is very dreadful\"\n",
      "null\t\" She brought her face close to her sister-in-laws  and unexpectedly again began to cry\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She needs rest, said Prince Andrew with a frown\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you,  Lise? Take her to your room and Ill go to Father\"\n",
      "null\t\" How is he? Just the same?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though I dont know what your opinion will  be, answered the princess joyfully\"\n",
      "null\t\" And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the lathe? asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was  aware of his weaknesses\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons, said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons  in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old  prince to get up, Tkhon came to call the young prince to his father\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his sons arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while  he dressed for dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his fathers dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered  chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tkhon\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah! heres the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte? said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tkhon  was holding fast to plait, would allow\"\n",
      "null\t\" You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this hell soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you? And he  held out his cheek\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" (He used to say that a nap after dinner was silverbefore dinner,  golden\"\n",
      "null\t\") He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his  thick, bushy eyebrows\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on  the spot indicated to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He made no reply on his fathers favorite topicmaking fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly  of Bonaparte\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant, said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his  fathers face with an eager and respectful look\"\n",
      "null\t\" How is your health?\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know me: I am busy from  morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thank God, said his son smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\" God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on, he continued, returning to his hobby; tell me how the Germans have taught you to  fight Bonaparte by this new science you call strategy\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\" Give me time to collect my wits, Father, said he, with a smile that showed that his fathers foibles did not prevent his son from  loving and honoring him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  house for your wife is ready\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary will take her there and  show her over, and theyll talk nineteen to the dozen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats  their womans way! I am glad to have her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sit down and talk\"\n",
      "null\t\" a simultaneous  expedition\"\n",
      "null\t\" But whats the southern army to do? Prussia is  neutral\"\n",
      "null\t\" What about Austria? said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tkhon, who ran after  him, handing him different articles of clothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?\"\n",
      "null\t\" He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand  men was to attack the French from different sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three  times unexpectedly interrupted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Once he stopped it by shouting: The white one, the white one!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another time he interrupted, saying:\"\n",
      "null\t\" The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his  description\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:  Malbrook sen va-t-en guerre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dieu sait quand reviendra\"\n",
      "null\t\"  His son only smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont say its a plan I approve of, said the son; I am  only telling you what it is\"\n",
      "null\t\" Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,  not worse than this one\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, youve told me nothing new, and the old man repeated, meditatively and rapidly:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go to the dining room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivnovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivnovich  was not a whit worse than you or I\"\n",
      "null\t\" At dinner the prince usually  spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivnovich more often than to anyone else\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmenone  behind each chairstood waiting for the prince to enter\"\n",
      "null\t\" The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door  by which the prince was to enter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolknski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crownan alleged descendant of Rrik and  ancestor of the Bolknskis\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at  a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing\"\n",
      "null\t\" How thoroughly like him that is! he said to Princess Mary, who had  come up to him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise\"\n",
      "null\t\" She did not understand  what he was laughing at\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything her father did inspired her with  reverence and was beyond question\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Everyone has his Achilles heel, continued Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brothers criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard  coming from the study\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners  with the strict formality of his house\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing  room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on  the little princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of  her neck\"\n",
      "null\t\" Im glad, glad, to see you, he said, looking attentively into  her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sit down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Ivnovich!\"\n",
      "null\t\" A footman moved  the chair for her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ho, ho! said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youve been in a hurry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats bad!\"\n",
      "null\t\" You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible, he  said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was  silent and seemed confused\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince asked her about her father, and  she began to smile and talk\"\n",
      "null\t\" He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings  from various people and retelling the town gossip\"\n",
      "null\t\" Countess Aprksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has  cried her eyes out, she said, growing more and more lively\"\n",
      "null\t\" As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a  definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivnovich\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, Michael Ivnovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time  of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew (he always spoke thus of his son) has been telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I  never thought much of him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Michael Ivnovich did not at all know when you and I had said such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the princes favorite topic, he looked  inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is a great tactician! said the prince to his son, pointing to  the architect\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the  generals and statesmen of the day\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Potmkins or Suvrovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing,  pretending to do something real\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew gaily bore with his fathers ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him  with evident pleasure\"\n",
      "null\t\" The past always seems good, said he, but did not Suvrov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suvrov! And he  jerked away his plate, which Tkhon briskly caught\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suvrov!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two\"\n",
      "null\t\" It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there youll find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvrov couldnt manage them so what chance has Michael Kutzov? No, my dear boy, he continued, you and your generals wont get on against Buonaparte; youll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight  together\"\n",
      "null\t\" The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau, he said, alluding to the invitation made  that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wonderful!\"\n",
      "null\t\" May God help  you, but well see what will happen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Buonaparte has become a great  commander among them! Hm!\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont at all say that all the plans are good, said Prince  Andrew, I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte\"\n",
      "null\t\" You may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  To be sure, your excellency, replied the architect\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The prince again laughed his frigid laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has got  splendid soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides he began by attacking Germans\"\n",
      "null\t\" Since the world began everybody  has beaten the Germans\"\n",
      "null\t\" They beat no oneexcept one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to  him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics\"\n",
      "null\t\" His son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were  presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion\"\n",
      "null\t\" He listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and  political events\"\n",
      "null\t\" You think Im an old man and dont understand the present state  of affairs? concluded his father\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont  sleep at night\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown  his skill? he concluded\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That would take too long to tell, answered the son\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, heres another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours, he  exclaimed in excellent French\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!\"\n",
      "null\t\" hummed the prince out of tune and, with  a laugh still more so, he quitted the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her  father-in-law and now at Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" When they left the table she  took her sister-in-laws arm and drew her into another room\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a clever man your father is, said she; perhaps that is why  I am afraid of him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, he is so kind! answered Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XXVIII\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince, not altering  his routine, retired as usual after dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess was in  her sister-in-laws room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without  epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he  ordered the horses to be harnessed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a sabera present from  his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochkov\"\n",
      "null\t\" All these traveling effects of Prince Andrews were in very good order: new,  clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes\"\n",
      "null\t\" When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable  of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" At such moments  one reviews the past and plans for the future\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrews face  looked very thoughtful and tender\"\n",
      "null\t\" With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him  and thoughtfully shaking his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable  expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrsha, she added,  as if to explain such a question\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She smiled as she uttered his pet name, Andrsha\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrshathe slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in  childhood\"\n",
      "null\t\" And where is Lise? he asked, answering her question only by a  smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have, said she, sitting  down on the sofa, facing her brother\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is quite a child: such a  dear, merry child\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and  contemptuous look that showed itself on his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them, Andrew? Dont forget that she has grown up and been educated in  society, and so her position now is not a rosy one\"\n",
      "null\t\" We should enter into  everyones situation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tout comprendre, cest tout pardonner\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * To understand all is to forgive all\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we  think we thoroughly understand\"\n",
      "null\t\" You live in the country and dont think the life terrible, he  replied\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I\"\n",
      "null\t\" thats different\"\n",
      "null\t\" But think, Andrew: for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her  life, all alonefor Papa is always busy, and I\"\n",
      "null\t\" well, you know what  poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all, said Prince  Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, shes much to be  pitied\"\n",
      "null\t\" To tell the truth, I dont need her,  and shes even in my way\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know I always was a savage, and now am  even more so\"\n",
      "null\t\" She and Michael Ivnovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and  kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both\"\n",
      "null\t\" As Sterne says: We dont love people so much for the good they have done us, as  for the good we have done them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Father took her when she was homeless  after losing her own father\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is very good-natured, and my father  likes her way of reading\"\n",
      "null\t\" She reads to him in the evenings and reads  splendidly\"\n",
      "null\t\" To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Fathers character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesnt it? Prince Andrew asked  suddenly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question\"\n",
      "null\t\"  For me? For me?\"\n",
      "null\t\" said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride, said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversationand thats a  great sin\"\n",
      "null\t\" How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so  contented and happy with him\"\n",
      "null\t\" I only wish you were all as happy as I  am\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Her brother shook his head incredulously\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The only thing that is hard for me\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will tell you the truth,  Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" is Fathers way of treating religious subjects\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is the only thing  that makes me unhappy\"\n",
      "null\t\" But even in this I can see lately a shade of  improvement\"\n",
      "null\t\" His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a  monk he received and had a long talk with\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your  powder, said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" she said timidly after a moments silence, I have a  great favor to ask of you\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is it, dear?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Promise,  Andrsha!\"\n",
      "null\t\" said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was  granted\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She looked timidly at her brother\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Even if it were a great deal of trouble\"\n",
      "null\t\" answered Prince Andrew,  as if guessing what it was about\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Think what you please! I know you are just like Father\"\n",
      "null\t\" Think as you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Fathers father, our  grandfather, wore it in all his wars\"\n",
      "null\t\" (She still did not take out  what she was holding in her reticule\"\n",
      "null\t\") So you promise?\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is it?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you promise?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  To please you\"\n",
      "null\t\" said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace, said she in a voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold  setting, on a finely wrought silver chain\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Please, Andrew, for my sake!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Those eyes lit  up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her brother  would have taken the icon, but she stopped him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Andrew understood,  crossed himself and kissed the icon\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was a look of tenderness, for  he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thank you, my dear\"\n",
      "null\t\" She kissed him on the forehead and sat down  again on the sofa\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were silent for a while\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is so  sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one\"\n",
      "null\t\" I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Msha, or blamed  her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why do you say all this to me?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to\"\n",
      "null\t\" And  I am sorry for that, he went on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks\"\n",
      "null\t\" She tried to  say something but could not\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her  fate, her father-in-law, and her husband\"\n",
      "null\t\" After crying she had fallen  asleep\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister\"\n",
      "null\t\" if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this  is so I dont know\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed  her forehead\"\n",
      "null\t\" His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over  her head toward the darkness of the open doorway\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Let us go to her, I must say good-by\"\n",
      "null\t\" Orgo and wake and Ill  come in a moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Petrshka! he called to his valet: Come here,  take these away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Put this on the seat and this to the right\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, maybe! said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go, Msha; Ill come  immediately\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the way to his sisters room, in the passage which connected one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling  sweetly\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and  artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh! I thought you were in your room, she said, for some reason  blushing and dropping her eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly  came over his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the  Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he reached his sisters room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying  one word after another, came through the open door\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make  up for lost time\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, but imagine the old Countess Zbova, with false curls and her  mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age\"\n",
      "null\t\" This very sentence about Countess Zbova and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some  five times\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking  incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after  their journey\"\n",
      "null\t\" She answered him and continued her chatter\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was an autumn  night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole\"\n",
      "null\t\" Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch\"\n",
      "null\t\" The immense  house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows\"\n",
      "null\t\" The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to  the young prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael Ivnovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess  Mary, and the little princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew had been called to his  fathers study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" All  were waiting for them to come out\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his  son, sat at the table writing\"\n",
      "null\t\" He glanced round\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ive come to say good-by\"\n",
      "null\t\" What do you thank me for?\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Service before everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thanks, thanks! And he went on  writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you have  anything to say, say it\"\n",
      "null\t\" These two things can be done together, he  added\"\n",
      "null\t\"  About my wife\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your  hands\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why talk nonsense? Say what you want\"\n",
      "null\t\"  When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let  him be here\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his  stern eyes on his son\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work, said  Prince Andrew, evidently confused\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know that out of a million  cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine\"\n",
      "null\t\" They have been  telling her things\"\n",
      "null\t\" She has had a dream and is frightened\"\n",
      "null\t\" muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he  was writing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill do it\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is bad, Father?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I dont understand! said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, it cant be helped, lad, said the prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyre  all like that; one cant unmarry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont be afraid; I wont tell  anyone, but you know it yourself\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his sons face with keen eyes which seemed to see  through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing  down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Whats to be done? Shes pretty! I will do everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Make your  mind easy, said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father  understood him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old man got up and gave the letter to his son\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilarinovich\"\n",
      "null\t\" Write and tell me how he receives you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas Bolknskis son need not serve under  anyone if he is in disfavor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now come here\"\n",
      "null\t\" He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son  was accustomed to understand him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his  bold, tall, close handwriting\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I shall probably die before you\"\n",
      "null\t\" So remember, these are my memoirs;  hand them to the Emperor after my death\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of  Suvrovs wars\"\n",
      "null\t\" Send it to the Academy\"\n",
      "null\t\" You will find them useful\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt that he must not say it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, now, good-by! He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,  your old father\"\n",
      "null\t\" he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: but if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolknski, I shall be ashamed!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The old man was silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" I also wanted to ask you, continued Prince Andrew, if Im killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from youas I  said yesterday\"\n",
      "null\t\" let him grow up with you\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They stood silent, facing one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old mans sharp eyes were  fixed straight on his sons\"\n",
      "null\t\" Something twitched in the lower part of  the old princes face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Weve said good-by\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go! he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry  voice, opening his door\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is it? What? asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white  dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well! he said, turning to his wife\"\n",
      "null\t\" And this Well! sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: Now  go through your performance\"\n",
      "null\t\" Andrew, already! said the little princess, turning pale and  looking with dismay at her husband\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He embraced her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder\"\n",
      "null\t\" Adieu, Mary, said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand  and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing  her temples\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince  Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man  angrily blowing his nose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white  dressing gown looked out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Gone? Thats all right! said he; and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed  the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the  inhabitants on whom they were quartered\"\n",
      "null\t\" Braunau was the headquarters of  the commander in chief, Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected  by the commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality and surroundingsfruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distanceand despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for  an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the evening of the last days march an order had been received that  the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is  always better to bow too low than not bow low enough\"\n",
      "null\t\" So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regimentinstead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day beforepresented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button  and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness\"\n",
      "null\t\" And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, awl,  soap, and all, as the soldiers say\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was only one circumstance  concerning which no one could be at ease\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the state of the  soldiers boots\"\n",
      "null\t\" More than half the mens boots were in holes\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from  chest to back than across the shoulders\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had on a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes  which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of  his life\"\n",
      "null\t\" He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled  himself up, slightly arching his back\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his  thoughts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, Michael Mtrich, sir? he said, addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that  they both felt happy)\"\n",
      "null\t\" We had our hands full last night\"\n",
      "null\t\" It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsartsin  Meadow\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What? asked the commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been  posted, two men appeared on horse back\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were an aide-de-camp  followed by a Cossack\"\n",
      "null\t\" The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation  whatever\"\n",
      "null\t\" A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutzov, not considering this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops  arrived from Russia\"\n",
      "null\t\" With this object he intended to meet the regiment; so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander  in chief would be\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the  commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied\"\n",
      "null\t\" On hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and  spread out his arms with a choleric gesture\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A fine mess weve made of it! he remarked\"\n",
      "null\t\" There now! Didnt I tell you, Michael Mtrich, that if it was said on the march it meant in greatcoats? said he reproachfully to  the battalion commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, my God! he added, stepping resolutely  forward\"\n",
      "null\t\" Company commanders! he shouted in a voice accustomed to  command\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sergeants major!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  In an hours time, I should say\"\n",
      "null\t\" Shall we have time to change clothes?\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the  soldiers to change into their greatcoats\"\n",
      "null\t\" The company commanders ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and  hum with voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on  with upraised arms\"\n",
      "null\t\" In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray  instead of black\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps  to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Whatever is this? This! he shouted and stood still\"\n",
      "null\t\" Commander of the third company!\"\n",
      "null\t\" commander to  the general\"\n",
      "null\t\" third company to the commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of: The general to the third company, the missing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his  toes toward the general\"\n",
      "null\t\" The captains face showed the uneasiness of  a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned\"\n",
      "null\t\" Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to  intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he  approached\"\n",
      "null\t\" You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this? shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish  cloth, which contrasted with the others\"\n",
      "null\t\" What have you been after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? Ill  teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade\"\n",
      "null\t\"?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, why dont you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a  Hungarian? said the commander with an austere gibe\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your  excellency?\"\n",
      "null\t\" nobody knows\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the  others\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march\"\n",
      "null\t\" Gave him leave? Leave? Thats just like you young men, said the  regimental commander cooling down a little\"\n",
      "null\t\" One says  a word to you and you\"\n",
      "null\t\" What? he added with renewed irritation, I  beg you to dress your men decently\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky  steps down the line\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for  wrath\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another  because his line was not straight, he reached the third company\"\n",
      "null\t\" H-o-o-w are you standing? Wheres your leg? Your leg? shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were  still five men between him and Dlokhov with his bluish-gray uniform\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his  clear, insolent eyes in the generals face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why a blue coat? Off with it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sergeant major! Change his coat\"\n",
      "null\t\" he did not finish\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dlokhov hurriedly interrupted\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No talking in the ranks!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not bound to endure insults, Dlokhov concluded in loud, ringing  tones\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The eyes of the general and the soldier met\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general became silent,  angrily pulling down his tight scarf\"\n",
      "null\t\" I request you to have the goodness to change your coat, he said as  he turned away\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER II\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself, drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening  his mouth awry, prepared to shout\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regiment fluttered like a bird  preening its plumage and became motionless\"\n",
      "null\t\" Att-ention! shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and  welcome for the approaching chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high, light blue Viennese calche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn  by six horses at a smart trot\"\n",
      "null\t\" Behind the calche galloped the suite  and a convoy of Croats\"\n",
      "null\t\" Beside Kutzov sat an Austrian general, in  a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  calche stopped in front of the regiment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov and the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kutzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did  not exist\"\n",
      "null\t\" The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a  jingling sound it presented arms\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then amidst a dead silence the  feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regiment roared,  Health to your ex\"\n",
      "null\t\" lency! and again all became  silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" At first Kutzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the  ranks\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even  greater zeal than his duty as a commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that  had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition\"\n",
      "null\t\" There  were only 217 sick and stragglers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything was in good order except  the boots\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes  also to the soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help  noticing what a bad state of things it was\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the  commander in chiefs regarding the regiment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Behind Kutzov, at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed  some twenty men of his suite\"\n",
      "null\t\" These gentlemen talked among themselves  and sometimes laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked  a handsome adjutant\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was Prince Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked  beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\" This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental  commanders back and mimicked his every movement\"\n",
      "null\t\" Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward  in exactly the same manner\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski laughed and nudged the others to  make them look at the wag\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were  starting from their sockets to watch their chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" On reaching the  third company he suddenly stopped\"\n",
      "null\t\" His suite, not having expected this,  involuntarily came closer to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, Timkhin! said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had  been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat\"\n",
      "null\t\" One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Timkhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutzov, who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his  scarred and puffy face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Another Ismail comrade, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" A brave officer! Are you  satisfied with him? he asked the regimental commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" We all have our weaknesses, said Kutzov smiling and walking away  from him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did  not answer\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose  with such exactitude that Nesvtski could not help laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov  turned round\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and while Kutzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume  a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" The third company was the last, and Kutzov pondered, apparently trying  to recollect something\"\n",
      "null\t\" You told me to remind you of the officer Dlokhov, reduced to the  ranks in this regiment\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Where is Dlokhov? asked Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov, who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat,  did not wait to be called\"\n",
      "null\t\" The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went  up to the commander in chief, and presented arms\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Have you a complaint to make? Kutzov asked with a slight frown\"\n",
      "null\t\"  This is Dlokhov, said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah! said Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" I hope this will be a lesson to you\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor is gracious, and I shant forget you if you deserve  well\"\n",
      "null\t\" The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief  so widely from a private\"\n",
      "null\t\" One thing I ask of your excellency, Dlokhov said in his firm,  ringing, deliberate voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!\"\n",
      "null\t\" The same smile of the eyes with which he had  turned from Captain Timkhin again flitted over his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" He turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dlokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was  weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted\"\n",
      "null\t\" He turned away and  went to the carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and  to rest after their hard marches\"\n",
      "null\t\" You wont bear me a grudge, Prokhr Igntych? said the regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its  quarters and riding up to Captain Timkhin who was walking in front\"\n",
      "null\t\" (The regimental commanders face now that the inspection was happily  over beamed with irrepressible delight\"\n",
      "null\t\") Its in the Emperors  service\"\n",
      "null\t\" one is sometimes a bit hasty on  parade\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am the first to apologize, you know me!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont mention it, General, as if Id be so bold! replied the captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end  of a gun at Ismail\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And tell Mr\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov that I wont forget himhe may be quite  easy\"\n",
      "null\t\" And tell me, pleaseIve been meaning to askhow is he  behaving himself, and in general\"\n",
      "null\t\" As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency;  but his character\"\n",
      "null\t\" said Timkhin\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its different on different days, answered the captain\"\n",
      "null\t\" One day he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next hes  a wild beast\"\n",
      "null\t\" In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Still, one  must have pity on a young man in misfortune\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know he has important  connections\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, then, you just\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, of course, of course!\"\n",
      "null\t\" epaulettes\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, thats all right, continued the regimental commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" A cup of vodka for the men from me, he added so that the soldiers  could hear\"\n",
      "null\t\" I thank you all! God be praised! and he rode past that  company and overtook the next one\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, hes really a good fellow, one can serve under him, said  Timkhin to the subaltern beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  In a word, a hearty one\"\n",
      "null\t\" said the subaltern, laughing (the  regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts)\"\n",
      "null\t\" The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the  soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers voices could be  heard on every side\"\n",
      "null\t\" And they said Kutzov was blind of one eye?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Boots and leg bands\"\n",
      "null\t\"  When he looked at my feet, friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" well, thinks I\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I say, Fdeshon!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Did he say when the battles are to begin? You  were near him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just listen to the fool, what he doesnt  know! The Prussians are up in arms now\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Austrians, you see, are  putting them down\"\n",
      "null\t\" When theyve been put down, the war with Buonaparte  will begin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youd better listen more carefully!\"\n",
      "null\t\" they will have their buckwheat  cooked before we reach our quarters\"\n",
      "null\t\" Give me a biscuit, you devil!\"\n",
      "null\t\" They might call a halt here or well have to do another four miles  without eating\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wasnt it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still  and are drawn along\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly\"\n",
      "null\t\" There they all seemed to be Polesall under the Russian crownbut here theyre  all regular Germans\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Singers to the front came the captains order\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front\"\n",
      "null\t\" A drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers song, commencing with the words: Morning dawned, the sun was rising, and concluding: On  then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father Kmenski\"\n",
      "null\t\" This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that the words Father Kmenski were replaced by  Father Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground, the drummera lean, handsome soldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his  eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and began:\"\n",
      "null\t\"!\"\n",
      "null\t\"! chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and  flourished his castanets as if threatening someone\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long  steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs,  and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov and his suite were  returning to the town\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing  soldier and the gay and smartly marching men\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company,  a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was Dlokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that  moment marching with the company\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hussar cornet of Kutzovs suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the  carriage and rode up to Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hussar cornet Zherkv had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to  the wild set led by Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Zherkv had met Dlokhov abroad as a  private and had not seen fit to recognize him\"\n",
      "null\t\" But now that Kutzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of  an old friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear fellow, how are you? said he through the singing, making  his horse keep pace with the company\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How am I? Dlokhov answered coldly\"\n",
      "null\t\" The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherkv spoke, and to the intentional coldness of  Dlokhovs reply\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And how do you get on with the officers? inquired Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All right\"\n",
      "null\t\" They are good fellows\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Both were silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve, went the  song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect  of that song\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Is it true that Austrians have been beaten? asked Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The devil only knows! They say so\"\n",
      "null\t\" Im glad, answered Dlokhov briefly and clearly, as the song  demanded\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say, come round some evening and well have a game of faro!  said Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, have you too much money?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I cant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ive sworn not to\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, thats only till the first engagement\"\n",
      "null\t\"  We shall see\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They were again silent\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Come if you need anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" One can at least be of use on the  staff\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dlokhov smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\" If I want anything, I wont begIll take it!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And I only\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Good-by\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Good health\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its a long, long way\"\n",
      "null\t\" To my native land\"\n",
      "null\t\" Zherkv touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the  song\"\n",
      "null\t\" On returning from the review, Kutzov took the Austrian general into his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of  the advanced army\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew Bolknski came into the room with the  required papers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath  were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah!\"\n",
      "null\t\" said Kutzov glancing at Bolknski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the  conversation in French\"\n",
      "null\t\" All I can say, General, said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each  deliberately spoken word\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that Kutzov himself listened  with pleasure to his own voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the  Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should long  ago have joined the archduke\"\n",
      "null\t\" And believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful generalof whom Austria has so manyand to lay down all this heavy  responsibility\"\n",
      "null\t\" But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,  General\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Kutzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, You are quite at liberty not to believe me and I dont even care whether you do or  not, but you have no grounds for telling me so\"\n",
      "null\t\" And that is the whole  point\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply  in the same tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the contrary, he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, on the contrary, your excellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles, he concluded his evidently  prearranged sentence\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kutzov bowed with the same smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need  our aid, said Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The general frowned\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutzovs suggestion of an Austrian victory  sounded much like irony\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Kutzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose  so\"\n",
      "null\t\" And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Macks army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the  army was very favorable\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Give me that letter, said Kutzov turning to Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with  which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech\"\n",
      "null\t\" Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful  ally\"\n",
      "null\t\" We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with  it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the  member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively\"\n",
      "null\t\" But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect the worst, said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done  with jests and to come to business\"\n",
      "null\t\" He involuntarily looked round at the  aide-de-camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" Excuse me, General, interrupted Kutzov, also turning to Prince  Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlvski all the  reports from our scouts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these, he said, handing him several papers, make a neat memorandum in French out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the  movements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what Kutzov would have  liked to tell him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,  stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he  had changed greatly during that period\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the expression of his face, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former  affected languor and indolence\"\n",
      "null\t\" He now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with  agreeable and interesting work\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter  and more attractive\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,  and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions\"\n",
      "null\t\" From Vienna Kutzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrews father\"\n",
      "null\t\" Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,  firmness, and expedition\"\n",
      "null\t\" I consider myself fortunate to have such a  subordinate by me\"\n",
      "null\t\" On Kutzovs staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two  quite opposite reputations\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince  Andrew was natural and pleasant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Others, the majority, disliked him and  considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable\"\n",
      "null\t\" But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even  feared him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Coming out of Kutzovs room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,  Kozlvski, who was sitting at the window with a book\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, Prince? asked Kozlvski\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not  advancing\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why is it?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Any news from Mack?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Probably, said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door\"\n",
      "null\t\" But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,  who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew stopped short\"\n",
      "null\t\" Commander in Chief Kutzov? said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and  advancing straight toward the inner door\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commander in chief is engaged, said Kozlvski, going  hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whom shall I announce?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The commander in chief is engaged, repeated Kozlvski calmly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The generals face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled\"\n",
      "null\t\" He took out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the leaf, gave it to Kozlvski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, Why do they look at me? Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which  immediately broke off\"\n",
      "null\t\" The door of the private room opened and Kutzov  appeared in the doorway\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides  with his thin legs, went up to Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Vous voyez le malheureux Mack, he uttered in a broken voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly  immobile for a few moments\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed  the door himself behind him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten  and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct\"\n",
      "null\t\" Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been  inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest  lay in the general progress of the war\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he saw Mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the Russian armys position, and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to  play\"\n",
      "null\t\" Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a weeks time he might, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the  French since Suvrov met them\"\n",
      "null\t\" He feared that Bonapartes genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same  time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced\"\n",
      "null\t\" Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his  room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the corridor he met Nesvtski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherkv;  they were as usual laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why are you so glum? asked Nesvtski noticing Prince Andrews  pale face and glittering eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Theres nothing to be gay about, answered Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvtski and Zherkv, there came toward them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who was on Kutzovs staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous  evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherkv, pushing Nesvtski aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,\"\n",
      "null\t\" theyre coming!\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the face of the wag Zherkv there suddenly  appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress\"\n",
      "null\t\" Your excellency, said he in German, stepping forward and addressing the Austrian general, I have the honor to congratulate  you\"\n",
      "null\t\" He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the  other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson\"\n",
      "null\t\" The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moments  attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening\"\n",
      "null\t\" General Mack has arrived, quite well, only a little bruised just here, he added, pointing with a  beaming smile to his head\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The general frowned, turned away, and went on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Gott, wie naiv! * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but Bolknski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and  turned to Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\" The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the  Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkvs untimely jest\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself, he said sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, I cant prevent your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my  presence, I will teach you to behave yourself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski and Zherkv were so surprised by this outburst that they  gazed at Bolknski silently with wide-open eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Whats the matter? I only congratulated them, said Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am not jesting with you; please be silent! cried Bolknski, and taking Nesvtskis arm he left Zherkv, who did not know what to  say\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come, whats the matter, old fellow? said Nesvtski trying to  soothe him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats the matter? exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in  his excitement\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you understand that either we are officers serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely  lackeys who care nothing for their masters business\"\n",
      "null\t\" Quarante mille hommes massacrs et larme de nos allis dtruite, et vous trouvez l le mot pour rire, * he said, as if strengthening his  views by this French sentence\"\n",
      "null\t\" Cest bien pour un garon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas  pour vous\"\n",
      "null\t\" *(2) Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way, he added in Russianbut pronouncing the word with a French  accenthaving noticed that Zherkv could still hear him\"\n",
      "null\t\" * Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned  and went out of the corridor\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER IV\"\n",
      "null\t\" The squadron in which Nicholas Rostv served as a cadet was quartered in  the German village of Salzeneck\"\n",
      "null\t\" The best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalry-captain Densov, the squadron commander, known  throughout the whole cavalry division as Vska Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Cadet Rostv, ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the  squadron commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of Macks defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was  proceeding as usual\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov, who had been losing at cards all night, had not yet come home when Rostv rode back early in the morning from  a foraging expedition\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to  part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, Bondarnko, dear friend! said he to the hussar who rushed up  headlong to the horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" Walk him up and down, my dear fellow, he continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young  people show to everyone when they are happy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, your excellency, answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his  head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mind, walk him up and down well!\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to  serve him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv patted the horses neck and then his flank, and  lingered for a moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Splendid! What a horse he will be! he thought with a smile, and holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the  porch\"\n",
      "null\t\" His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face  immediately brightened on seeing Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Schn gut Morgen! Schn gut Morgen! * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased  to greet the young man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Schon fleissig? * said Rostv with the same gay brotherly smile  which did not leave his eager face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch! *(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by  the German landlord\"\n",
      "null\t\" Und die ganze Welt hoch! *\"\n",
      "null\t\" What about your master? he asked Lavrshka, Densovs orderly,  whom all the regiment knew for a rogue\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hasnt been in since the evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" Must have been losing,  answered Lavrshka\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means hes lost and  will come back in a rage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Will you have coffee?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ten minutes later Lavrshka brought the coffee\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hes coming!  said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now for trouble! Rostv looked out of the window and  saw Densov coming home\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov was a small man with a red face,  sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wore an unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled  shako on the back of his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging  his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lavwska! he shouted loudly and angrily, take it off, blockhead!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, youre up already, said Densov, entering the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Long ago, answered Rostv, I have already been for the hay,  and have seen Frulein Mathilde\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Weally! And Ive been losing, bwother\"\n",
      "null\t\" I lost yesterday like a  damned fool! cried Densov, not pronouncing his rs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Such ill  luck! Such ill luck\"\n",
      "null\t\" Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick  tangled black hair\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what devil made me go to that wat? (an officer nicknamed the rat) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both  hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just fancy, he didnt let me win a single cahd, not one  cahd\"\n",
      "null\t\" He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he  continued to shout\"\n",
      "null\t\" He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it; gives the singles and snatches the doubles!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully  with his glittering, black eyes at Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" If at least we had some women here; but theres nothing foh one  to do but dwink\"\n",
      "null\t\" If we could only get to fighting soon\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The squadron quartermaster! said Lavrshka\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Densovs face puckered still more\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Wetched! he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wostv, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the  purse undah the pillow, he said, and went out to the quartermaster\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins  in separate piles, began counting them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah! Telynin! How dye do? They plucked me last night, came  Densovs voice from the next room\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Where? At Bykovs, at the rats\"\n",
      "null\t\" I knew it, replied a piping voice, and Lieutenant Telynin, a small officer of the same squadron,  entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand  which was offered him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Telynin for some reason had been transferred  from the Guards just before this campaign\"\n",
      "null\t\" He behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked; Rostv especially detested him and was  unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" (Rook  was a young horse Telynin had sold to Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\")\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I saw you riding this morning\"\n",
      "null\t\" he added\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hes begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg, he  added\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The hoofs cracked! Thats nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill teach you what to do  and show you what kind of rivet to use\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, please do, said Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ill show you, Ill show you! Its not a secret\"\n",
      "null\t\" And its a  horse youll thank me for\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then Ill have it brought round, said Rostv wishing to avoid  Telynin, and he went out to give the order\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the passage Densov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold  facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" On seeing Rostv, Densov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telynin was sitting, he frowned and gave a  shudder of disgust\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ugh! I dont like that fellow, he said, regardless of the  quartermasters presence\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: Nor do I, but whats one to do? and, having given his order, he returned to  Telynin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Telynin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostv had  left him, rubbing his small white hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well there certainly are disgusting people, thought Rostv as he  entered\"\n",
      "null\t\" Have you told them to bring the horse? asked Telynin, getting up  and looking carelessly about him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I have\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Let us go ourselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" I only came round to ask Densov about  yesterdays order\"\n",
      "null\t\" Have you got it, Densov?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse, said  Telynin\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They went through the porch and into the stable\"\n",
      "null\t\" The lieutenant  explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Rostv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the  table\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of  paper\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked gloomily in Rostvs face and said: I am witing  to her\"\n",
      "null\t\" He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and, evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to  write, told Rostv the contents of his letter\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You see, my fwiend, he said, we sleep when we dont love\"\n",
      "null\t\" We  are childwen of the dust\"\n",
      "null\t\" but one falls in love and one is a God, one  is pua as on the fihst day of cweation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whos that now? Send him to the devil, Im busy! he shouted to Lavrshka, who went up to  him not in the least abashed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Who should it be? You yourself told him to come\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its the  quartermaster for the money\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Densov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Wetched business, he muttered to himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" How much is left in  the puhse? he asked, turning to Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Seven new and three old imperials\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, its wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you  scacwow? Call the quahtehmasteh, he shouted to Lavrshka\"\n",
      "null\t\" Please, Densov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,  said Rostv, blushing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont like bowwowing from my own fellows, I dont, growled  Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" But if you wont accept money from me like a comrade, you will  offend me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Really I have some, Rostv repeated\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And Densov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where have you put it, Wostv?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its not there\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Densov threw both pillows on the floor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The purse was not there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wait, havent you dropped it? said Rostv, picking up the  pillows one at a time and shaking them\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He pulled off the quilt and shook it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The purse was not there\"\n",
      "null\t\" I put it just  here\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where is it? he asked, turning to Lavrshka\"\n",
      "null\t\" It must be where you put it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youre always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, if I hadnt thought of it being a treasure, said Rostv,  but I remember putting it there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lavrshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the  room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov silently watched Lavrshkas movements, and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found  Densov glanced at Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Wostv, youve not been playing schoolboy twicks\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv felt Densovs gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and  instantly dropped them again\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the blood which had seemed congested  somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could not  draw breath\"\n",
      "null\t\" And there hasnt been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and  yourselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now then, you devils puppet, look alive and hunt for it! shouted Densov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with  a threatening gesture\"\n",
      "null\t\" If the purse isnt found Ill flog you,  Ill flog you all\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, his eyes avoiding Densov, began buttoning his coat, buckled  on his saber, and put on his cap\"\n",
      "null\t\" I must have that purse, I tell you, shouted Densov, shaking his  orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov, let him alone, I know who has taken it, said Rostv,  going toward the door without raising his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov paused, thought a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostv hinted at, seized  his arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nonsense! he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood  out like cords\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are mad, I tell you\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know who has taken it, repeated Rostv in an unsteady voice,  and went to the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I tell you, dont you dahe to do it! shouted Densov,  rushing at the cadet to restrain him\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Rostv pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though Densov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his  face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you understand what youre saying? he said in a trembling  voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was no one else in the room except myself\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He could not finish, and ran out of the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody, were the last words  Rostv heard\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv went to Telynins quarters\"\n",
      "null\t\" The master is not in, hes gone to headquarters, said  Telynins orderly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Has something happened? he added, surprised  at the cadets troubled face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Youve only just missed him, said the orderly\"\n",
      "null\t\" The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and  Rostv, without returning home, took a horse and rode there\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was  an inn in the village which the officers frequented\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv rode up to  it and saw Telynins horse at the porch\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of  sausages and a bottle of wine\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, youve come here too, young man! he said, smiling and  raising his eyebrows\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, said Rostv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the  word; and he sat down at the nearest table\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Both were silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the  room\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives  and the munching of the lieutenant\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Telynin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to  the waiter\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Please be quick, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The coin was a new one\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv rose and went up to Telynin\"\n",
      "null\t\" With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telynin handed him the  purse\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, its a nice purse\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, yes, he said, growing suddenly  pale, and added, Look at it, young man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and  looked at Telynin\"\n",
      "null\t\" The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way  and suddenly seemed to grow very merry\"\n",
      "null\t\" If we get to Vienna Ill get rid of it there but in these wretched  little towns theres nowhere to spend it, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, let me  have it, young man, Im going\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv did not speak\"\n",
      "null\t\" And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite  decently here, continued Telynin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now then, let me have it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv let go of  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Telynin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open, as if to say, Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my  pocket and thats quite simple and is no one elses business\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, young man? he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted  brows he glanced into Rostvs eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telynins eyes to  Rostvs and back, and back again and again in an instant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come here, said Rostv, catching hold of Telynins arm and  almost dragging him to the window\"\n",
      "null\t\" That money is Densovs; you  took it\"\n",
      "null\t\" he whispered just above Telynins ear\"\n",
      "null\t\" But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for  pardon\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as Rostv heard them, an enormous load of doubt  fell from him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be  completed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine, muttered  Telynin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room\"\n",
      "null\t\" We  must have an explanation\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I know it and shall prove it, said Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every muscle of Telynins pale, terrified face began to quiver, his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising  to Rostvs face, and his sobs were audible\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Count!\"\n",
      "null\t\" here is this wretched money,  take it\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have an old father and  mother!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv took the money, avoiding Telynins eyes, and went out of the  room without a word\"\n",
      "null\t\" But at the door he stopped and then retraced his  steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" O God, he said with tears in his eyes, how could you do it?\"\n",
      "null\t\" said Telynin drawing nearer to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you need it,  take the money, and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn\"\n",
      "null\t\" That same evening there was an animated discussion among the  squadrons officers in Densovs quarters\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I tell you, Rostv, that you must apologize to the colonel! said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostv who was crimson with  excitement\"\n",
      "null\t\" The staff captain, Krsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for  affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I will allow no one to call me a liar! cried Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" He told  me I lied, and I told him he lied\"\n",
      "null\t\" He may keep me on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it  beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then\"\n",
      "null\t\" You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen, interrupted  the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache\"\n",
      "null\t\" You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an  officer has stolen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Im not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of  other officers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am  not a diplomatist\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lyingso let him  give me satisfaction\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats all right\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one thinks you a coward, but thats not the  point\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the  conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He answered the  staff captains question by a disapproving shake of his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers, continued the staff captain, and Bogdnich (the  colonel was called Bogdnich) shuts you up\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must  apologize\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Not on any account! exclaimed Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" I did not expect this of you, said the staff captain seriously and  severely\"\n",
      "null\t\" You dont wish to apologize, but, man, its not only to  him but to the whole regimentall of usyoure to blame all round\"\n",
      "null\t\" The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the  officers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one  scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We dont see it like that\"\n",
      "null\t\" And  Bogdnich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its not pleasant, but whats to be done, my dear fellow? You landed  yourself in it\"\n",
      "null\t\" And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole  affair public\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdnich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! Youre quick at taking offense, but you dont mind disgracing the whole regiment!  The staff captains voice began to tremble\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, youre here today and tomorrow youll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said There are thieves among the Pvlograd officers! But its not all the same to us! Am I not right, Densov? Its not the same!\"\n",
      "null\t\" You value your own pride and dont wish to apologize, continued the staff captain, but we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the  regiment, and Bogdnich knows it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And all this is not right, its not right! You may take offense or not but  I always stick to mother truth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its not right!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats twue, devil take it! shouted Densov, jumping up\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer  and then at the other\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, gentlemen, no\"\n",
      "null\t\" you mustnt think\"\n",
      "null\t\" for the honor of  the regiment Id\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah well, Ill show that in action, and for me  the honor of the flag\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, never mind, its true Im to blame,  to blame all round\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, what else do you want?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I tell you, shouted Densov, hes a fine fellow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats better, Count, said the staff captain, beginning to  address Rostv by his title, as if in recognition of his confession\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go and apologize, your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, go!\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one shall hear a word from me, said Rostv in an imploring voice, but I cant apologize, by God I cant, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Itll be worse for you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bogdnich is vindictive and youll pay  for your obstinacy, said Krsten\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, on my word its not obstinacy! I cant describe the feeling\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cant\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, its as you like, said the staff captain\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what has  become of that scoundrel? he asked Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has weported himself sick, hes to be stwuck off the list  tomowwow, muttered Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is an illness, theres no other way of explaining it, said  the staff captain\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Illness or not, hed better not cwoss my path\"\n",
      "null\t\" Id kill him!  shouted Densov in a bloodthirsty tone\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Just then Zherkv entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What brings you here? cried the officers turning to the newcomer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Were to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his  whole army\"\n",
      "null\t\" What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I congratulated him on  Macks arrival\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats the matter, Rostv? You look as if youd  just come out of a hot bath\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, my dear fellow, were in such a stew here these last two  days\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by  Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Were going into action, gentlemen!\"\n",
      "null\t\" On October 23 the  Russian troops were crossing the river Enns\"\n",
      "null\t\" At midday the Russian baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling  through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day\"\n",
      "null\t\" The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could  be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished\"\n",
      "null\t\" Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling  masses of Russian troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green  treetops and bluish gorges\"\n",
      "null\t\" The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the  enemys horse patrols could be discerned\"\n",
      "null\t\" Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through  his fieldglass\"\n",
      "null\t\" A little behind them Nesvtski, who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a  gun carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nesvtski was treating some officers to pies and real  doppelkmmel\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their  knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen? Nesvtski  was saying\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thank you very much, Prince, answered one of the officers, pleased  to be talking to a staff officer of such importance\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its a lovely  place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer\"\n",
      "null\t\" and what a splendid house!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Look there  in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyll ransack that castle, he remarked with evident approval\"\n",
      "null\t\"  So they will, said Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, but what I should like, added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, would be  to slip in over there\"\n",
      "null\t\" He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and  gleamed\"\n",
      "null\t\" That would be fine, gentlemen!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Just to flutter the nuns a bit\"\n",
      "null\t\" They say there are Italian girls  among them\"\n",
      "null\t\" They must be feeling dull, too, said one of the bolder officers,  laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to  the general, who looked through his field glass\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, so it is, so it is, said the general angrily, lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders, so it is! Theyll be fired  on at the crossing\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from  their battery a milk-white cloud arose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then came the distant report of  a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Nesvtski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Would not your excellency like a little refreshment? he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its a bad business, said the general without answering him,  our men have been wasting time\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hadnt I better ride over, your excellency? asked Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, please do, answered the general, and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail: and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the  inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very good, answered Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack  and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill really call in on the nuns, he said to the officers who watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the  hill\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Now then, lets see how far it will carry, Captain\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just try!  said the general, turning to an artillery officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Have a little fun  to pass the time\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Crew, to your guns! commanded the officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began  loading\"\n",
      "null\t\"  One! came the command\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Number one jumped briskly aside\"\n",
      "null\t\" The gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke  showing the spot where it burst\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly visible as if but a stones throw away, and the movements of the  approaching enemy farther off\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and  spirited impression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two of the enemys shots had already flown across the bridge, where  there was a crush\"\n",
      "null\t\" Halfway across stood Prince Nesvtski, who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the  railings\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few  steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles\"\n",
      "null\t\" Each time Prince Nesvtski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again  and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a fine fellow you are, friend! said the Cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were  crowded together close to his wheels and his horses\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a fellow! You cant wait a moment! Dont you see the general wants to pass?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hi there, boys! Keep to  the left! Wait a bit\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense  mass\"\n",
      "null\t\" Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvtski saw the rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of  the bridge chased each other along\"\n",
      "null\t\" Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the  bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officers or companys baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on  all sides, moved across the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its as if a dam had burst, said the Cossack hopelessly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Are there many more of you to come?\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he (he meant the enemy) begins popping at the bridge now, said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, youll forget to  scratch yourself\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to? said an  orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And he also passed on with the wagon\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then came some merry soldiers who  had evidently been drinking\"\n",
      "null\t\" And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt  end of his gun\"\n",
      "null\t\" a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said  gaily, with a wide swing of his arm\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, the ham was just delicious\"\n",
      "null\t\" answered another with a loud  laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvtski did not learn who  had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bah! How they scurry\"\n",
      "null\t\" He just sends a ball and they think theyll  all be killed, a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully\"\n",
      "null\t\" As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean, said a young soldier with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, I felt like  dying of fright\"\n",
      "null\t\" I did, pon my word, I got that frightened! said  he, as if bragging of having been frightened\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That one also passed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone  before\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and  seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects\"\n",
      "null\t\" A fine brindled cow with  a large udder was attached to the cart behind\"\n",
      "null\t\" A woman with an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks  were sitting on some feather beds\"\n",
      "null\t\" Evidently these fugitives were  allowed to pass by special permission\"\n",
      "null\t\" The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace  all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the  women\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sell me the missis, said another soldier, addressing the German, who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast  eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where are you going? asked an infantry officer who was eating an  apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Take it if you like, said the officer, giving the girl an apple\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The girl smiled and took it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski like the rest of the men on the  bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed\"\n",
      "null\t\" When they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same  kind of talk, and at last all stopped\"\n",
      "null\t\" As often happens, the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole  crowd had to wait\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why are they stopping? Theres no proper order! said the  soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Cant you wait?  Itll be worse if he fires the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\" See, heres an officer jammed in toodifferent voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked  at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\" Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvtski  suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching\"\n",
      "null\t\"  something big, that splashed into the water\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just see where it carries to! a soldier near by said sternly,  looking round at the sound\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Encouraging us to get along quicker, said another uneasily\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The crowd moved on again\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski realized that it was a cannon ball\"\n",
      "null\t\" With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting  continually he moved on\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still  harder from behind\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski, Nesvtski! you numskull! came a hoarse voice from  behind him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry, Vska Densov, red and shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily  over his shoulder\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass! shouted Densov evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small  bare hand as red as his face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, Vska! joyfully replied Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats up with you?\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is this? Theyre like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the  way!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Stop there, you devil with the cart! Ill hack you with my saber! he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its  scabbard and flourishing it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and  Densov joined Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hows it youre not drunk today? said Nesvtski when the  other had ridden up to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" They dont even give one time to dwink! answered Vska  Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a dandy you are today! said Nesvtski, looking at  Densovs new cloak and saddlecloth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused  a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvtskis nose\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Of course\"\n",
      "null\t\" Im going into action! Ive shaved, bwushed my teeth,  and scented myself\"\n",
      "null\t\" The imposing figure of Nesvtski followed by his Cossack, and the determination of Densov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through  to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Beside the bridge Nesvtski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order,  and having done this he rode back\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Having cleared the way Densov stopped at the end of the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\" Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw  nearer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping, resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge  on his side of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will, estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in  regular order\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Smart lads! Only fit for a fair! said one\"\n",
      "null\t\" What good are they? Theyre led about just for show! remarked  another\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont kick up the dust, you infantry! jested an hussar whose  prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Id like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack! Your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed, said an infantryman, wiping  the mud off his face with his sleeve\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perched up there, youre more  like a bird than a man\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There now, Zkin, they ought to put you on a horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youd look fine, said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under  the weight of his knapsack\"\n",
      "null\t\" Take a stick between your legs, thatll suit you for a horse!  the hussar shouted back\"\n",
      "null\t\" The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing  together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel\"\n",
      "null\t\" At last the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last  battalion came onto the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only Densovs squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the  river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our  Cossack scouts were moving\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly on the road at the top of the high  ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" These were the  French\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the officers and men of Densovs squadron, though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches  appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemys troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending  brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was calm, and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard  from the hill\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy  except a few scattered skirmishers\"\n",
      "null\t\" An empty space of some seven hundred  yards was all that separated them\"\n",
      "null\t\" The enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates  two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt\"\n",
      "null\t\" One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing  the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what is there? Who is there?there beyond that field, that tree, that  roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know\"\n",
      "null\t\" You fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will  inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death\"\n",
      "null\t\" But you are strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such  excitedly animated and healthy men\"\n",
      "null\t\" So thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that  takes place at such moments\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose,  and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  officers who had been standing together rode off to their places\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  hussars began carefully aligning their horses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Silence fell on the whole  squadron\"\n",
      "null\t\" All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron  commander, awaiting the word of command\"\n",
      "null\t\" A second and a third cannon  ball flew past\"\n",
      "null\t\" Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell  somewhere beyond them\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hussars did not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the  ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their  comrades impression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every face, from Densovs to that of the bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and  excitement, around chin and mouth\"\n",
      "null\t\" The quartermaster frowned, looking  at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Cadet Mirnov ducked  every time a ball flew past\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv on the left flank, mounted on his Rooka handsome horse despite its game leghad the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which  he feels sure he will distinguish himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was glancing at everyone with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly  he sat under fire\"\n",
      "null\t\" But despite himself, on his face too that same  indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whos that curtseying there? Cadet Miwnov! Thats not wight! Look at me, cried Densov who, unable to keep still on one spot,  kept turning his horse in front of the squadron\"\n",
      "null\t\" The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Vska Densov, and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he  was only redder than usual\"\n",
      "null\t\" With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in  a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols\"\n",
      "null\t\" He rode up to  Krsten\"\n",
      "null\t\" The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a  walk to meet him\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face with its long mustache was serious as always,  only his eyes were brighter than usual\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, what about it? said he to Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" It wont come to a  fight\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youll seewe shall retire\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, Wostv, he cried noticing the cadets bright face,  youve got it at last\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv  felt perfectly happy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just then the commander appeared on the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Your excellency! Let us attack them! Ill dwive them off\"\n",
      "null\t\" Attack indeed! said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his  face as if driving off a troublesome fly\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why are you stopping here? Dont you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron  back\"\n",
      "null\t\" The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without  having lost a single man\"\n",
      "null\t\" The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side  of the river\"\n",
      "null\t\" The two Pvlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the  hill one after the other\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their colonel, Karl Bogdnich Schubert, came up to Densovs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostv, without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the  first time since their encounter concerning Telynin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonels athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red  neck\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed to Rostv that Bogdnich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadets courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdnich rode so near in order to show him his  courage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a  desperate attack just to punish himRostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdnich would come up to him as he lay wounded and  would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation\"\n",
      "null\t\" The high-shouldered figure of Zherkv, familiar to the Pvlograds as  he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel\"\n",
      "null\t\" After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkv had not remained in the regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded  in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" He now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear  guard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Colonel, he said, addressing Rostvs enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, there is an order  to stop and fire the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\"  An order to who? asked the colonel morosely\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont myself know to who, replied the cornet in a serious tone, but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel  that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\" Zherkv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the  colonel of hussars with the same order\"\n",
      "null\t\" After him the stout Nesvtski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his  weight\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hows this, Colonel? he shouted as he approached\"\n",
      "null\t\" I told you to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all  beside themselves over there and one cant make anything out\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" You spoke to me of inflammable material, said he, but you said  nothing about firing it\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, my dear sir, said Nesvtski as he drew up, taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, wasnt I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put in position?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders  strictly to obey\"\n",
      "null\t\" You said the bridge would be burned, but who would burn it, I could not know by the holy spirit!\"\n",
      "null\t\" How did you get here? said he, turning to Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\" But you are damp! Let me wring you out!\"\n",
      "null\t\" continued the colonel in an  offended tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Colonel, interrupted the officer of the suite, You must be  quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot\"\n",
      "null\t\" The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout  staff officer, and at Zherkv, and he frowned\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will the bridge fire, he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still  do the right thing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron, that in which Rostv was serving under Densov, to return to  the bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There, its just as I thought, said Rostv to himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wishes to test me! His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his  face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let him see whether I am a coward! he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv watched his enemy, the colonel, closelyto find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostv, and looked  as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then came the word  of command\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Look sharp! Look sharp! several voices repeated around him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the  hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do\"\n",
      "null\t\" The men  were crossing themselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv no longer looked at the colonel, he  had no time\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid  that his heart stood still\"\n",
      "null\t\" His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderlys charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with  a thud\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs  catching and their sabers clattering\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Stretchers! shouted someone behind him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on, trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,  and fell on his hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" The others outstripped him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front  the better\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whos that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come back, Cadet! he cried angrily; and turning to Densov, who, showing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, every bullet has its billet, answered Vska Densov, turning  in his saddle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Meanwhile Nesvtski, Zherkv, and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blue  uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery\"\n",
      "null\t\" Will they burn the bridge or not? Wholl get there first? Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out? These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with  their bayonets and guns\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hussars will get it hot! said Nesvtski; they are  within grapeshot range now\"\n",
      "null\t\" He shouldnt have taken so many men, said the officer of the  suite\"\n",
      "null\t\" True enough, answered Nesvtski; two smart fellows could have  done the job just as well\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, your excellency, put in Zherkv, his eyes fixed on the hussars, but still with that nave air that made it impossible to know  whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, your excellency! How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the Vladmir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the  squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our  Bogdnich knows how things are done\"\n",
      "null\t\" There now! said the officer of the suite, thats  grapeshot\"\n",
      "null\t\" He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached  and hurriedly removed\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the  moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then two  reports one after another, and a third\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh! Oh! groaned Nesvtski as if in fierce pain, seizing the  officer of the suite by the arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!\"\n",
      "null\t\" If I were Tsar I would never go to war, said Nesvtski, turning  away\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The French guns were hastily reloaded\"\n",
      "null\t\" The infantry in their blue  uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run\"\n",
      "null\t\" Smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the  bridge\"\n",
      "null\t\" But this time Nesvtski could not see what was happening there,  as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was  someone to fire at\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars  got back to their horses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two were misdirected and the shot went too high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and  knocked three of them over\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, absorbed by his relations with Bogdnich, had paused on the  bridge not knowing what to do\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was no one to hew down (as he had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the  other soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest  to him fell against the rails with a groan\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv ran up to him with  the others\"\n",
      "null\t\" Again someone shouted, Stretchers! Four men seized the  hussar and began lifting him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oooh! For Christs sake let me alone! cried the wounded man, but  still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas Rostv turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the  sun\"\n",
      "null\t\" How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the  waters of the distant Danube shone\"\n",
      "null\t\" And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and  the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was peace  and happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I  were there, thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" In myself alone and in that sunshine  there is so much happiness; but here\"\n",
      "null\t\" groans, suffering, fear, and  this uncertainty and hurry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Therethey are shouting again, and again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it,  death, is here above me and around\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another instant and I shall never  again see the sun, this water, that gorge!\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other  stretchers came into view before Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the fear of death and of the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one  feeling of sickening agitation\"\n",
      "null\t\" O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect  me! Rostv whispered\"\n",
      "null\t\" The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices  sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, fwiend? So youve smelt powdah! shouted Vska Densov  just above his ear\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its all over; but I am a cowardyes, a coward! thought Rostv, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting  one foot, from the orderly and began to mount\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Was that grapeshot? he asked Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes and no mistake! cried Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" You worked like wegular bwicks and its nasty work! An attacks pleasant work! Hacking away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them  shooting at you like a target\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Densov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostv, composed  of the colonel, Nesvtski, Zherkv, and the officer from the suite\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, it seems that no one has noticed, thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" And this  was true\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation  which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Heres something for you to report, said Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\" See if I  dont get promoted to a sublieutenancy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Inform the prince that I the bridge fired! said the colonel  triumphantly and gaily\"\n",
      "null\t\" And if he asks about the losses?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by Kutzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as  necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment\"\n",
      "null\t\" There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the courage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which the Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more  rapid retreat\"\n",
      "null\t\" Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kutzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and  Kutzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of\"\n",
      "null\t\" Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics, had been handed to Kutzov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were  advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the twenty-eighth of October Kutzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time  with the river between himself and the main body of the French\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the thirtieth he attacked Mortiers division, which was on the left bank,  and broke it up\"\n",
      "null\t\" In this action for the first time trophies were taken:  banners, cannon, and two enemy generals\"\n",
      "null\t\" For the first time, after a fortnights retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight  had not only held the field but had repulsed the French\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kutzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of  the army considerably\"\n",
      "null\t\" Throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of  the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian  General Schmidt, who was killed in the action\"\n",
      "null\t\" His horse had been  wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet\"\n",
      "null\t\" As a mark of the commander in chiefs special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was  threatened by the French) but at Brnn\"\n",
      "null\t\" Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhtrov to  Kutzov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brnn\"\n",
      "null\t\" To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward  promotion\"\n",
      "null\t\" The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that  had fallen the previous daythe day of the battle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a  man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the  wheels and the sensation of victory\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that  this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away\"\n",
      "null\t\" He again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage  during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off\"\n",
      "null\t\" The dark  starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning\"\n",
      "null\t\" The snow was thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides  of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages\"\n",
      "null\t\"  At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front  cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse\"\n",
      "null\t\" In each of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being  jolted over the stony road\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some of them were talking (he heard Russian words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy  hurrying past them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what  action they had been wounded\"\n",
      "null\t\" Day before yesterday, on the Danube,  answered the soldier\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the  soldier three gold pieces\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats for them all, he said to the officer who came up\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Get well soon, lads! he continued, turning to the soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theres plenty to do still\"\n",
      "null\t\" What news, sir? asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a  conversation\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Good news!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go on! he shouted to the driver, and they galloped  on\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved streets of Brnn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a  soldier after camp life\"\n",
      "null\t\" Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and  alert than he had done the day before\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and  rapidity\"\n",
      "null\t\" He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself  stating them to the Emperor Francis\"\n",
      "null\t\" He vividly imagined the casual  questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  expected to be at once presented to the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the chief entrance to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and  learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find  the adjutant on duty, said the official\"\n",
      "null\t\" He will conduct you to  the Minister of War\"\n",
      "null\t\" The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went  in to the Minister of War\"\n",
      "null\t\" Five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a  corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work\"\n",
      "null\t\" The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any  attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he  approached the door of the ministers room\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt offended, and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into  one of disdain which was quite uncalled for\"\n",
      "null\t\" His fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise  the adjutant and the minister\"\n",
      "null\t\" Away from the smell of powder, they  probably think it easy to gain victories! he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with  peculiarly deliberate steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes  taking no notice of his arrival\"\n",
      "null\t\" A wax candle stood at each side of the  ministers bent bald head with its gray temples\"\n",
      "null\t\" He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the  sound of footsteps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Take this and deliver it, said he to his adjutant, handing him the  papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutzovs army interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that  impression\"\n",
      "null\t\" But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me, he  thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them  evenly, and then raised his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and  habitual to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is  continually receiving many petitioners one after another\"\n",
      "null\t\"  From General Field Marshal Kutzov? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" I hope it is good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high time!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt! he exclaimed in German\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a calamity! What a calamity!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is  not captured\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am very glad you have brought good news, though Schmidts death is a heavy price to pay for the  victory\"\n",
      "null\t\" I  thank you! You must have a rest\"\n",
      "null\t\" Be at the levee tomorrow after the  parade\"\n",
      "null\t\" The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,  reappeared\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Au revoir! Thank you very much\"\n",
      "null\t\" His Majesty will probably desire to  see you, he added, bowing his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the  indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant\"\n",
      "null\t\" The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed  the memory of a remote event long past\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew stayed at Brnn with Bilbin, a Russian acquaintance of  his in the diplomatic service\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,  said Bilbin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Franz, put the princes things in my bedroom, said he to the servant who was  ushering Bolknski in\"\n",
      "null\t\" So youre a messenger of victory, eh?  Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see\"\n",
      "null\t\" After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomats  luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bilbin  settled down comfortably beside the fire\"\n",
      "null\t\" After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such  as he had been accustomed to from childhood\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides it was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian (for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was  then particularly strong\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bilbin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as  Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but  had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession, so to an even greater extent Bilbin gave  promise of rising in his diplomatic career\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was still a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather  important post in Vienna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both the foreign minister and our ambassador  in Vienna knew him and valued him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities,  avoid doing certain things, and speak French\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would  sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table\"\n",
      "null\t\" He worked well  whatever the import of his work\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was not the question What for?  but the question How? that interested him\"\n",
      "null\t\" What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and  elegantly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bilbins services were valued not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the  highest spheres\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bilbin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be  made elegantly witty\"\n",
      "null\t\" In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was  possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,  finished phrases of general interest\"\n",
      "null\t\" These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to  drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" And, in fact, Bilbins witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters  considered important\"\n",
      "null\t\" His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers after a  Russian bath\"\n",
      "null\t\" The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play  of expression on his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and  deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks\"\n",
      "null\t\" His small, deep-set eyes always  twinkled and looked out straight\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, now tell me about your exploits, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bolknski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the  engagement and his reception by the Minister of War\"\n",
      "null\t\" They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of  skittles, said he in conclusion\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bilbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared\"\n",
      "null\t\" Cependant, mon cher, he remarked, examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, malgr la haute estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, javoue que  votre victoire nest pas des plus victorieuses\"\n",
      "null\t\" * But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian army, I must say that your victory was not  particularly victorious\"\n",
      "null\t\" He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in  Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers! Wheres the victory?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why didnt you capture one, just one, marshal for us?\"\n",
      "null\t\" We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by  seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why didnt you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have  been there at seven in the morning, returned Bilbin with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" You ought to have been there at seven in the morning\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa alone? retorted Prince Andrew  in the same tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know, interrupted Bilbin, youre thinking its very easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why didnt you capture him? So dont be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and  King Francis is not much delighted by your victory\"\n",
      "null\t\" Even I, a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the  Prater\"\n",
      "null\t\" True, we have no Prater here\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It is now my turn to ask you why? mon cher, said Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" I confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I cant make it  out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke  Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov alone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care  to hear the details\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats just it, my dear fellow\"\n",
      "null\t\" You see its hurrah for the Tsar, for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archdukes as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonapartes, that will be another story and well fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done  on purpose to vex us\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke  Ferdinand disgraces himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" You abandon Vienna, give up its defenseas much as to say: Heaven is with us, but heaven help you and your capital! The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit  that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose\"\n",
      "null\t\" What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?\"\n",
      "null\t\" After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and especially after having dined, Bolknski felt that he could not take in  the full significance of the words he heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Lichtenfels was here this morning, Bilbin continued, and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna  was fully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement\"\n",
      "null\t\" You see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant be  received as a savior\"\n",
      "null\t\" Really I dont care about that, I dont care at all, said Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as  the fall of Austrias capital\"\n",
      "null\t\" How is it Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard  reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna? he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is defending usdoing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending  us\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been  given to blow it up\"\n",
      "null\t\" Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad  quarter of an hour between two fires\"\n",
      "null\t\" But still this does not mean that the campaign is over, said  Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, I think it is\"\n",
      "null\t\" The bigwigs here think so too, but they  darent say so\"\n",
      "null\t\" It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it wont be your skirmishing at Drrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will decide the matter, but those who devised it, said Bilbin quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and  pausing\"\n",
      "null\t\" The only question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia  joins the Allies, Austrias hand will be forced and there will be war\"\n",
      "null\t\" If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of  the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up\"\n",
      "null\t\" What an extraordinary genius! Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed, clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, and what luck the man has!\"\n",
      "null\t\" But joking apart, said Prince Andrew, do you really think the campaign is over?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Austria has been made a fool of, and she is  not used to it\"\n",
      "null\t\" She will retaliate\"\n",
      "null\t\" And thereforethis is between ourselvesI instinctively feel that we are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and  projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * Fine eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Impossible! cried Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" That would be too base\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far  away from him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The alliance with Prussia, Austrias treachery, Bonapartes new triumph, tomorrows levee and parade, and the  audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts\"\n",
      "null\t\" He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since  childhood\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He woke up\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, that all happened! he said, and, smiling happily to himself  like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XI\"\n",
      "null\t\" Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite  Austrian adjutant, Bilbin, and last nights conversation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into Bilbins study fresh,  animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the study were four  gentlemen of the diplomatic corps\"\n",
      "null\t\" With Prince Hippolyte Kurgin,  who was a secretary to the embassy, Bolknski was already acquainted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bilbin introduced him to the others\"\n",
      "null\t\" The gentlemen assembled at Bilbins were young, wealthy, gay society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bilbin, their  leader, called les ntres\"\n",
      "null\t\" * This set, consisting almost exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to  the official side of the service\"\n",
      "null\t\" These gentlemen received Prince  Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many\"\n",
      "null\t\" From politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry  jests and gossip\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * Ours\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the best of it was, said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat, that the Chancellor told him flatly that his  appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Can you fancy the figure he cut?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its  arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" He began to laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent! cried several voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" You, Bolknski, dont know, said Bilbin turning to Prince Andrew, that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * Woman is mans companion\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bilbin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in Hippolytes face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whomhe had to admithe had almost been jealous on his wifes account, was the butt  of this set\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, I must give you a treat, Bilbin whispered to Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kurgin is exquisite when he discusses politicsyou should see his gravity!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these  two\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance, began Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, without  expressing\"\n",
      "null\t\" you understand\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Wait, I have not finished\"\n",
      "null\t\" he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him by the arm, I believe that intervention will be stronger than  nonintervention\"\n",
      "null\t\" he paused\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is how it will end\"\n",
      "null\t\" Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth! said Bilbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with  satisfaction\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was evidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild  laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well now, gentlemen, said Bilbin, Bolknski is my guest in  this house and in Brnn itself\"\n",
      "null\t\" I want to entertain him as far as I  can, with all the pleasures of life here\"\n",
      "null\t\" If we were in Vienna it would be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult,  and I beg you all to help me\"\n",
      "null\t\" You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course  the women\"\n",
      "null\t\" We must let him see Amelie, shes exquisite! said one of  ours, kissing his finger tips\"\n",
      "null\t\" In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane  interests, said Bilbin\"\n",
      "null\t\" I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality, gentlemen, it is already time for me to go, replied Prince Andrew  looking at his watch\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where to?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, au revoir, Bolknski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to  dinner, cried several voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated, said Bilbin,  accompanying him to the hall\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts,  I cant, replied Bolknski, smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, talk as much as you can, anyway\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has a passion for giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and cant do it, as  you will see\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XII\"\n",
      "null\t\" But after it was over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed  Bolknski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor  Francis received him standing in the middle of the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor  seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Tell me, when did the battle begin? he asked hurriedly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew replied\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then followed other questions just as simple:  Was Kutzov well? When had he left Krems? and so on\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsthe answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest  him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  At what oclock did the battle begin? asked the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cannot inform Your Majesty at what oclock the battle began at the front, but at Drrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in the afternoon, replied Bolknski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which  he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the Emperor  smiled and interrupted him\"\n",
      "null\t\" How many miles?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Three and a half miles, Your Majesty\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French have abandoned the left bank?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is there sufficient forage in Krems?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Emperor interrupted him\"\n",
      "null\t\" At what oclock was General Schmidt killed?\"\n",
      "null\t\" At seven oclock? Its very sad, very sad!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew withdrew and  was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everywhere he  saw friendly looks and heard friendly words\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yesterdays adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him  his own house\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring  on him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Empress chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not know whom to answer, and  for a few seconds collected his thoughts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Contrary to Bilbins forecast the news he had brought was joyfully  received\"\n",
      "null\t\" A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutzov was awarded  the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bolknski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning  calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries\"\n",
      "null\t\" Between four and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bilbins house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle  and his visit to Brnn\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the door he found a vehicle half full of  luggage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Franz, Bilbins man, was dragging a portmanteau with some  difficulty out of the front door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before returning to Bilbins Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some  time in the shop\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What is it? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, your excellency! said Franz, with difficulty rolling the  portmanteau into the vehicle, we are to move on still farther\"\n",
      "null\t\" The scoundrel is again at our heels!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bilbin came out to meet him\"\n",
      "null\t\" His usually calm face showed excitement\"\n",
      "null\t\" This  affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna\"\n",
      "null\t\" They have crossed without striking a blow!\"\n",
      "null\t\" But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I heard nothing there\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is it all about? inquired Prince Andrew  impatiently\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is now rushing along the road to Brnn and will be here in a day or  two\"\n",
      "null\t\" What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why\"\n",
      "null\t\" But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It  will be cut off, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats just it, answered Bilbin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Listen! The French entered  Vienna as I told you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Very well\"\n",
      "null\t\") Gentlemen, says one of them, you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take  it! Yes, lets! say the others\"\n",
      "null\t\" And off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the  Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * The marshalls\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Stop jesting, said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously\"\n",
      "null\t\" This news  grieved him and yet he was pleased\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! Listening to Bilbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the  executing of the plan\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Stop this jesting, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I am not jesting, Bilbin went on\"\n",
      "null\t\" These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on  their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg\"\n",
      "null\t\" He lets them enter the  tte-de-pont\"\n",
      "null\t\" * They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with  Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into  the water, and approaches the tte-de-pont\"\n",
      "null\t\" At length appears the  lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars!  Hostilities are ended, we can shake one anothers hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auerspergs  acquaintance\"\n",
      "null\t\" In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Murats mantle and ostrich plumes, quil ny voit que du feu, et oublie celui quil devait faire faire sur lennemi! *(2) In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilbin did not forget to  pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all, he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes  stayed his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French! Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: I dont recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that! It  was a stroke of genius\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and  orders the sergeant to be arrested\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come, you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor  rascality\"\n",

      "null\t\" * (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that  he ought to be firing at the enemy\"\n",
      "null\t\" It may be treachery, said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing,  and the glory that awaited him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Not that either\"\n",
      "null\t\" That puts the court in too bad a light, replied  Bilbin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is  just as at Ulm\"\n",
      "null\t\"he seemed to be trying to find the right  expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" cest du Mack\"\n",
      "null\t\" We are Macked), he concluded, feeling that he  had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated\"\n",
      "null\t\" His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a  slight smile he began to examine his nails\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where are you off to? he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had  risen and was going toward his room\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I am going away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where to?\"\n",
      "null\t\" But you meant to stay another two days?\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to  his room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you know, mon cher, said Bilbin following him, I have been  thinking about you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why are you going?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to  the army now that it is in danger\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mon cher, it is heroism!\"\n",
      "null\t\" But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary,  is to take care of yourself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Leave it to those who are no longer fit for  anything else\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our  ill luck takes us\"\n",
      "null\t\" They say we are going to Olmtz, and Olmtz is a  very decent town\"\n",
      "null\t\" You and I will travel comfortably in my calche\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things, and the skin over his left temple puckered, either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will  share defeat and disgrace with Kutzovs whole army\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Bilbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was  insoluble\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cannot argue about it, replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he  thought: I am going to save the army\"\n",
      "null\t\"  My dear fellow, you are a hero! said Bilbin\"\n",
      "null\t\" That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, Bolknski set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and  fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems\"\n",
      "null\t\" In Brnn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy  baggage was already being dispatched to Olmtz\"\n",
      "null\t\" Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with  great haste and in the greatest disorder\"\n",
      "null\t\" The road was so obstructed  with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the  commander in chief and of his own luggage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of  the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors\"\n",

      "null\t\" Well, if need be, I shall do it no  worse than others\"\n",
      "null\t\" * That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same  fate(the fate of the army at Ulm)\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and  sometimes four abreast\"\n",
      "null\t\" From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the  urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers\"\n",
      "null\t\" All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or  returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks\"\n",
      "null\t\" At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the  din of shouting more incessant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud  pushed the guns and wagons themselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,  traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officers  directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces  that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army, thought Bolknski,  recalling Bilbins words\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to  a convoy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and  looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a calche\"\n",
      "null\t\" A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the  apron under the leather hood of the vehicle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention  was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle\"\n",
      "null\t\" An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the womans vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes  of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage\"\n",
      "null\t\" The woman screamed  piercingly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Protect me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh  Chasseurs\"\n",
      "null\t\" They wont let us pass, we are left behind and have lost  our people\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill flatten you into a pancake! shouted the angry officer to  the soldier\"\n",
      "null\t\" Turn back with your slut!\"\n",
      "null\t\" What does it all mean? screamed the  doctors wife\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kindly let this cart pass\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you see its a woman? said  Prince Andrew riding up to the officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the  soldier\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let them pass, I tell you! repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his  lips\"\n",
      "null\t\" And who are you? cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage, who are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here,  not you! Go back or Ill flatten you into a pancake, repeated he\"\n",
      "null\t\" This expression evidently pleased him\"\n",
      "null\t\" That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp, came a voice  from behind\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,  tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying\"\n",
      "null\t\" He saw that his championship of the doctors wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule; but  his instinct urged him on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before the officer finished his sentence Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised  his riding whip\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kind\"\n",
      "null\t\"ly letthempass!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its all the fault of these fellows on the staff that theres  this disorder, he muttered\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctors wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told who the commander in chief  was\"\n",
      "null\t\" On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house, intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort  out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" This is a mob of scoundrels and not an army, he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by  name\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He turned round\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtskis handsome face looked out of the little  window\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and  flourishing his arm, called him to enter\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bolknski! Bolknski!\"\n",
      "null\t\" he  shouted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvtski and another adjutant  having something to eat\"\n",
      "null\t\" They hastily turned round to him asking if he  had any news\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was particularly noticeable on Nesvtskis usually laughing  countenance\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Where is the commander in chief? asked Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Here, in that house, answered the adjutant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, is it true that its peace and capitulation? asked  Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I was going to ask you\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know nothing except that it was all I could  do to get here\"\n",
      "null\t\" And we, my dear boy! Its terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,  were getting it still worse, said Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" But sit down and  have something to eat\"\n",
      "null\t\" You wont be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,  Prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" And God only knows where your man Peter is, said the other  adjutant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where are headquarters?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses, said  Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyve made up splendid packs for mefit to cross  the Bohemian mountains with\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its a bad lookout, old fellow! But whats the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that, he  added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its nothing, replied Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctors wife and  the convoy officer\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What is the commander in chief doing here? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I cant make out at all, said Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable, quite abominable! said Prince Andrew, and he went off to  the house where the commander in chief was\"\n",
      "null\t\" Passing by Kutzovs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince  Andrew entered the passage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov himself, he was told, was in the  house with Prince Bagratin and Weyrother\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother was the Austrian  general who had succeeded Schmidt\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the passage little Kozlvski was  squatting on his heels in front of a clerk\"\n",
      "null\t\" The clerk, with cuffs turned  up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kozlvskis  face looked wornhe too had evidently not slept all night\"\n",
      "null\t\" He glanced  at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Second line\"\n",
      "null\t\" have you written it? he continued dictating to the  clerk\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian\"\n",
      "null\t\" Through the door came the sounds of Kutzovs voice, excited and  dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the sound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlvski looked at him, the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and Kozlvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and  disastrous was about to happen\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He turned to Kozlvski with urgent questions\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Immediately, Prince, said Kozlvski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dispositions for  Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" What about capitulation?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Orders are issued for a battle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and  Kutzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutzov but the expression of the commander in chiefs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied  with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  looked straight at his adjutants face without recognizing him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, have you finished? said he to Kozlvski\"\n",
      "null\t\"  One moment, your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,  impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have the honor to present myself, repeated Prince Andrew rather  loudly, handing Kutzov an envelope\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, from Vienna? Very good\"\n",
      "null\t\" Later, later!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, good-by, Prince, said he to Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" My blessing, and may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!\"\n",
      "null\t\" With his left hand he drew Bagratin toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagratin kissed him on the  neck instead\"\n",
      "null\t\" Christ be with you! Kutzov repeated and went toward his  carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Get in with me, said he to Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Allow me to remain  with Prince Bagratins detachment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Get in, said Kutzov, and noticing that Bolknski still delayed, he added: I need good officers myself, need them myself!\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is still much, much before us, he said, as if with an old mans penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolknskis  mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,  he added as if speaking to himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew glanced at Kutzovs face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty  eye socket\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those mens  death, thought Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kutzov did not reply\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seemed to have forgotten what he had been  saying, and sat plunged in thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" Five minutes later, gently swaying  on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was not a trace of agitation on his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems  affair, and about some ladies they both knew\"\n",
      "null\t\" On November 1 Kutzov had received, through a spy, news that the army  he commanded was in an almost hopeless position\"\n",
      "null\t\" The spy reported that the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immense force upon Kutzovs line of communication with the troops  that were arriving from Russia\"\n",
      "null\t\" If Kutzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleons army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he  would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm\"\n",
      "null\t\" If Kutzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and  abandoning all hope of a junction with Buxhwden\"\n",
      "null\t\" If Kutzov decided to retreat along the road from Krems to Olmtz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an  enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kutzov chose this latter course\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles  off on the line of Kutzovs retreat\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he reached Znaim before the French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a  disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction\"\n",
      "null\t\" But to forestall  the French with his whole army was impossible\"\n",
      "null\t\" The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the  Russians from Krems to Znaim\"\n",
      "null\t\" The night he received the news, Kutzov sent Bagratins vanguard, four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim  to the Vienna-Znaim road\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin was to make this march without resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as  possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov himself with all his transport took the road to  Znaim\"\n",
      "null\t\" Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, Bagratin came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrnn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrnn from  Vienna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov with his transport had still to march for some days  before he could reach Znaim\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hence Bagratin with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army  that came upon him at Hollabrnn, which was clearly impossible\"\n",
      "null\t\" But  a freak of fate made the impossible possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without  a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutzov in a similar way\"\n",
      "null\t\" Meeting Bagratins weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be  Kutzovs whole army\"\n",
      "null\t\" To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three days truce on condition that  both armies should remain in position without moving\"\n",
      "null\t\" Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he  therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murats emissary and retired, leaving Bagratins division  exposed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace  negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days truce\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutzov to report the offer he had  received\"\n",
      "null\t\" A truce was Kutzovs sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagratins exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance  if but one stage nearer Znaim\"\n",
      "null\t\" The offer of a truce gave the only, and  a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army\"\n",
      "null\t\" On receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in  attendance on him, to the enemy camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kutzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim  road\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratins exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to  remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzovs expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass, and also that Murats mistake would very soon be discovered, proved  correct\"\n",
      "null\t\" at eight oclock in the morning\"\n",
      "null\t\" You command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my  order\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign\"\n",
      "null\t\" Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no  one but the Emperor of Russia has that right\"\n",
      "null\t\" If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will  ratify it; but it is only a trick\"\n",
      "null\t\" March on, destroy the Russian  army\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery\"\n",
      "null\t\" Officers are  nothing when they have no powers; this one had none\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are  letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" NAPOLEON\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim escape, and Bagratins four thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store  for him\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XV\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bonapartes adjutant had not yet reached  Murats detachment and the battle had not yet begun\"\n",
      "null\t\" In Bagratins  detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs\"\n",
      "null\t\" They talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked  of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin, knowing Bolknski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, which is also  very important\"\n",
      "null\t\" However, there will hardly be an engagement today, said Bagratin  as if to reassure Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he  wishes to stay with me, let him\"\n",
      "null\t\" hell be of use here if hes a  brave officer, thought Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the princes permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent  to execute an order\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking  French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches,  and fencing from the village\"\n",
      "null\t\" There now, Prince! We cant stop those fellows, said the staff  officer pointing to the soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officers dont keep them in  hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" And there, he pointed to a sutlers tent, they crowd in  and sit\"\n",
      "null\t\" This morning I turned them all out and now look, its full  again\"\n",
      "null\t\" It wont take a  moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, lets go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,  said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why didnt you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you  something\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They dismounted and entered the tent\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several officers, with flushed and  weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now what does this mean, gentlemen? said the staff officer, in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more  than once\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know it wont do to leave your posts like this\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now you, Captain, and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether  comfortably\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, arent you ashamed of yourself, Captain Tshin? he  continued\"\n",
      "null\t\" One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded and youll be in a pretty position without your boots! (The  staff officer smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\") Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of  you, all! he added in a tone of command\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer Tshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes  from Prince Andrew to the staff officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers say it feels easier without boots, said Captain Tshin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing  to adopt a jocular tone\"\n",
      "null\t\" But before he had finished he felt that his  jest was unacceptable and had not come off\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kindly return to your posts, said the staff officer trying to  preserve his gravity\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officers small figure\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic,  but extremely attractive\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up  red\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants; spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the  bank by unseen hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at  the entrenchment, and went on again\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the  entrenchment\"\n",
      "null\t\" They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a  trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines\"\n",
      "null\t\" Voil lagrment des camps, monsieur le prince, * said the  staff officer\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They rode up the opposite hill\"\n",
      "null\t\" From there the French could already be  seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats our battery, said the staff officer indicating the  highest point\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its in charge of the queer fellow we saw without  his boots\"\n",
      "null\t\" You can see everything from there; lets go there,  Prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thank you very much, I will go on alone, said Prince Andrew, wishing to rid himself of this staff officers company, please  dont trouble yourself further\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and  cheerful were the troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" The greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven  miles away from the French\"\n",
      "null\t\" At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the  more confident was the appearance of our troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in  the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up\"\n",
      "null\t\" Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending  boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers\"\n",
      "null\t\" In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log  before his shelter, had been tasted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka, crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting  a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces, emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and  wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats\"\n",
      "null\t\" All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in  which at least half of them would be left on the field\"\n",
      "null\t\" After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiersfine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairsnear the shelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came  out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and  striking him regularly on his bare back\"\n",
      "null\t\" The man shrieked unnaturally\"\n",
      "null\t\" So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural  screams, continued\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Go on, go on! said the major\"\n",
      "null\t\" A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant  as he rode by\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one  anothers faces and speak to one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers  who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies\"\n",
      "null\t\" Since early morningdespite an injunction not to approach the picket  linethe officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and  grew weary waiting to be relieved\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew halted to have a look  at the French\"\n",
      "null\t\" Look! Look there! one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and  was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hark to him jabbering! Fine, isnt it? Its all the Frenchy can do to keep up  with him\"\n",
      "null\t\" There now, Sdorov!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its fine! answered Sdorov, who was  considered an adept at French\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew  recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with  his captain\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now then, go on, go on! incited the officer, bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" More, please: more! Whats he saying?\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were naturally talking about the  campaign\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm, while Dlokhov maintained that the Russians had not  surrendered but had beaten the French\"\n",
      "null\t\" We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,  said Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured! said  the French grenadier\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The French onlookers and listeners laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well make you dance as we did under Suvrov\"\n",
      "null\t\", * said  Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * On vous fera danser\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Qu est-ce quil chante? * asked a Frenchman\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its ancient history, said another, guessing that it referred to  a former war\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the  others\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bonaparte\"\n",
      "null\t\" began Dlokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him\"\n",
      "null\t\"! cried he angrily\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Dlokhov swore at him in coarse soldiers Russian and shouldering  his musket walked away\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Let us go, Ivn Lukch, he said to the captain\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, thats the way to talk French, said the picket soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sdorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast: Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kask, he said,  trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh! came peals of such healthy and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as  quickly as possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon  confronted one another as before\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had  told him the whole field could be seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here he dismounted, and stopped  beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the  officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes  and artillerymens bonfires\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the left, not far from the farthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the  sound of officers voices in eager conversation\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the  greater part of the enemys opened out from this battery\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just facing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schn Grabern could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were  evidently in the village itself and behind the hill\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the left from that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it  was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our right flank was  posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the  dragoons\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the center, where Tshins battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schn  Grabern\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked  the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us  on both sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it  difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the  position\"\n",
      "null\t\" He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to  Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the  dip\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the  course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline\"\n",
      "null\t\" He imagined only important possibilities: If the enemy attacks the right flank, he said to himself, the Kiev grenadiers and the Podlsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center  come up\"\n",
      "null\t\" In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank  counterattack\"\n",
      "null\t\" If they attack our center we, having the center battery on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and  retreat to the dip by echelons\"\n",
      "null\t\" So he reasoned\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the  shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, friend, said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a familiar voice, what I say is that if it were possible to know  what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats so,  friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: Afraid or not, you cant  escape it anyhow\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people, said a third  manly voice interrupting them both\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of course you artillery men are very wise, because you can take everything along with youvodka and  snacks\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,  laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, one is afraid, continued the first speaker, he of the  familiar voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" One is afraid of the unknown, thats what it is\"\n",
      "null\t\" we know there is  no sky but only an atmosphere\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tshin, it said\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, thought Prince Andrew, thats the captain who stood up  in the sutlers hut without his boots\"\n",
      "null\t\" He recognized the agreeable,  philosophizing voice with pleasure\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Some herb vodka? Certainly! said Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\" But still, to  conceive a future life\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He did not finish\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near  the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth\"\n",
      "null\t\" The ground  seemed to groan at the terrible impact\"\n",
      "null\t\" And immediately Tshin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who  hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,  looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball\"\n",
      "null\t\" His eyes ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was  a battery to their left\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two  mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill\"\n",
      "null\t\" A small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,  probably to strengthen the front line\"\n",
      "null\t\" The smoke of the first shot had  not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report\"\n",
      "null\t\" The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back  to Grunth to find Prince Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" He heard the cannonade behind him  growing louder and more frequent\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came  the report of musketry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonapartes stern letter, and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to  crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It has begun\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here it is! thought Prince Andrew, feeling the  blood rush to his heart\"\n",
      "null\t\" Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his  heart\"\n",
      "null\t\" It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable! was what  the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw,  in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a  white horse, was Prince Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagratin reined in his horse and recognizing  Prince Andrew nodded to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew  told him what he had seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" The feeling, It has begun! Here it is! was seen even on Prince  Bagratins hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking  and feeling at that moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is there anything at all behind that  impassive face? Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said, Very good! in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he  had foreseen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke  quickly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin, uttering his words with an Oriental accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no  need to hurry\"\n",
      "null\t\" However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction  of Tshins battery\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew followed with the suite\"\n",
      "null\t\" The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with a nave smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on  his horse with a convoy officers saddle\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wants to see a battle, said Zherkv to Bolknski, pointing to the accountant, but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach  already\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, leave off! said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkvs  joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince, said the staff officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" (He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a  prince, but could not get it quite right\"\n",
      "null\t\")\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats that that has fallen? asked the accountant with a nave  smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A French pancake, answered Zherkv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  So thats what they hit with? asked the accountant\"\n",
      "null\t\" How awful!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly  ended with a thud into something soft\"\n",
      "null\t\" f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with  his horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" Zherkv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and  turned their horses away\"\n",
      "null\t\" The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack,  and examined him with attentive curiosity\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Cossack was dead, but the  horse still struggled\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say, Is it worth while noticing trifles? He reined in his horse with the care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his  saber which had caught in his cloak\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was an old-fashioned saber of  a kind no longer in general use\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvrov giving his saber to Bagratin in Italy, and the recollection  was particularly pleasant at that moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" They had reached the battery  at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whose company? asked Prince Bagratin of an artilleryman standing  by the ammunition wagon\"\n",
      "null\t\" He asked, Whose company? but he really meant, Are you  frightened here? and the artilleryman understood him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Captain Tshins, your excellency! shouted the red-haired,  freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, yes, muttered Bagratin as if considering something, and he  rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its  former position\"\n",
      "null\t\" A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with  a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth\"\n",
      "null\t\" The short, round-shouldered Captain Tshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out  shading his eyes with his small hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lift it two lines more and it will be just right, cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to  his weak figure\"\n",
      "null\t\" Number Two! he squeaked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though Tshins guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Schn Grabern visible just  opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one had given Tshin orders where and at what to fire, but after consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchnko, for whom he had great respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the  village\"\n",
      "null\t\" Very good! said Bagratin in reply to the officers report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended  before him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French had advanced nearest on our right\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain  without support\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin turned to the officer and with his  dull eyes looked at him in silence\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officers remark was just and that really no answer could be made to  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in  disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin  bowed his head in sign of assent and approval\"\n",
      "null\t\" He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the  French\"\n",
      "null\t\" But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the  wood\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very good! said Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself, Prince Bagratin sent Zherkv to tell the general in command (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutzov at Braunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear, as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemys  attack very long\"\n",
      "null\t\" About Tshin and the battalion that had been in  support of his battery all was forgotten\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagratins colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were really given, but that Prince Bagratin tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least  in accord with his intentions\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew noticed, however, that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders will, owing to the tact Bagratin showed, his presence  was very valuable\"\n",
      "null\t\" Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display  their courage before him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin, having reached the highest point of our right flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where  on account of the smoke nothing could be seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" The nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness  of the actual battlefield\"\n",
      "null\t\" They began to meet wounded men\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was a gurgle in his throat and he  was spitting blood\"\n",
      "null\t\" A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or  mouth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while  blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had  that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering\"\n",
      "null\t\" Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were  unwounded\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and  despite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating\"\n",
      "null\t\" In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagratin rushed shouting after  the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning  the sound of voices and the shouts of command\"\n",
      "null\t\" The whole air reeked with  smoke\"\n",
      "null\t\" The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it\"\n",
      "null\t\" A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were  often heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is this? thought Prince Andrew approaching the  crowd of soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" It cant be an attack, for they are not moving;  it cant be a squarefor they are not drawn up for that\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a pleasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes, giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagratin and welcomed him as  a host welcomes an honored guest\"\n",
      "null\t\" He reported that his regiment had been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been  repulsed, he had lost more than half his men\"\n",
      "null\t\" He said the attack had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his  regiment had been broken up\"\n",
      "null\t\" All he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted Cavalry! and  our men had begun firing\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were still firing, not at the cavalry which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the  hollow and were firing at our men\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin bowed his head as a  sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected\"\n",
      "null\t\" Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the  Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew was struck by  the changed expression on Prince Bagratins face at this moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of  a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water\"\n",
      "null\t\" The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation  of profound thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" The round, steady, hawks eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his  movements were still slow and measured\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagratin, entreating  him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were\"\n",
      "null\t\" Please, your excellency, for Gods sake! he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away  from him\"\n",
      "null\t\" There, you see! and he drew attention to the bullets  whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them\"\n",
      "null\t\" He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister  your hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his  half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words\"\n",
      "null\t\" The staff officer joined in the colonels appeals, but Bagratin did not reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room  for the two approaching battalions\"\n",
      "null\t\" While he was speaking, the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before  them\"\n",
      "null\t\" All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing  against them and winding down over the uneven ground\"\n",
      "null\t\" One could already see the soldiers shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men,  and see the standard flapping against its staff\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They march splendidly, remarked someone in Bagratins suite\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The head of the column had already descended into the hollow\"\n",
      "null\t\" The clash  would take place on this side of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came  two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before they had reached Bagratin, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in  step could be heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" On their left flank, nearest to Bagratin, marched a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy  expressionthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he  would appear as he passed the commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy  tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men  without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he  was happy\"\n",
      "null\t\" left\"\n",
      "null\t\" left\"\n",
      "null\t\" A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his  defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company\"\n",
      "null\t\" A cannon ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagratin and his suite,  and fell into the column to the measure of Left\"\n",
      "null\t\" left! Close  up! came the company commanders voice in jaunty tones\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one  seemed to hear left\"\n",
      "null\t\" left\"\n",
      "null\t\" Glad to do our best, your exlen-lency! came a confused shout  from the ranks\"\n",
      "null\t\" A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagratin as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: We know that ourselves! Another, without looking round, as though  fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The order was given to halt and down knapsacks\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin rode round the ranks that had marched past him and  dismounted\"\n",
      "null\t\" He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his  felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight\"\n",
      "null\t\" The head of the  French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill\"\n",
      "null\t\" Forward, with God! said Bagratin, in a resolute, sonorous voice, turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms, he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of  a cavalryman\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him  forward, and experienced great happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The French were already near\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagratin, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their  faces\"\n",
      "null\t\" (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered  legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty\"\n",
      "null\t\") Prince Bagratin gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in  front of the ranks\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots  sounded\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer  who had marched so gaily and complacently\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hurrahah!ah! rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and passing Bagratin and racing one another they rushed in an irregular  but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe\"\n",
      "null\t\" The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right  flank\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the center Tshins forgotten battery, which had managed to  set fire to the Schn Grabern village, delayed the French advance\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus  gave us time to retreat\"\n",
      "null\t\" The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the  different companies did not get mixed\"\n",
      "null\t\" But our leftwhich consisted of the Azv and Podlsk infantry and the Pvlograd hussarswas simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under  Lannes and was thrown into confusion\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin had sent Zherkv to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat  immediately\"\n",
      "null\t\" Zherkv, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about  and galloped off\"\n",
      "null\t\" But no sooner had he left Bagratin than his courage  failed him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was seized by panic and could not go where it was  dangerous\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they  could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order\"\n",
      "null\t\" The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment Kutzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dlokhov was  serving as a private\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the Pvlograd regiment in which Rostv  was serving, and a misunderstanding arose\"\n",
      "null\t\" The two commanders were much exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged  in discussion with the sole object of offending one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the  impending action\"\n",
      "null\t\" From privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the  horses and the infantry collecting wood\"\n",
      "null\t\" He higher iss dan I in rank, said the German colonel of the hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, so  let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bugler, sount ze retreat!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Cannon and musketry, mingling together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of Lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and  forming up within twice the range of a musket shot\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the  Pvlograd commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commanders met with polite bows but with  secret malevolence in their hearts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Once again, Colonel, said the general, I cant leave half  my men in the wood\"\n",
      "null\t\" I beg of you, I beg of you, he repeated, to  occupy the position and prepare for an attack\"\n",
      "null\t\" I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!  suddenly replied the irate colonel\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you vere in the cavalry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Quite avare, your excellency, suddenly shouted the colonel,  touching his horse and turning purple in the face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I dont vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Taking the colonels outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the  bullets\"\n",
      "null\t\" They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and  they halted in silence\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground,  as well as that the French were outflanking our left\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs  of cowardice in the other\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both passed the examination successfully\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French had  attacked the men collecting wood in the copse\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was no longer possible  for the hussars to retreat with the infantry\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were cut off from  the line of retreat on the left by the French\"\n",
      "null\t\" However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through  for themselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" The squadron in which Rostv was serving had scarcely time to mount  before it was halted facing the enemy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Again, as at the Enns bridge, there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearresembling the line  separating the living from the deadlay between them\"\n",
      "null\t\" All were conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross  it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all\"\n",
      "null\t\" The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having  his own way, gave an order\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one said anything definite, but the rumor  of an attack spread through the squadron\"\n",
      "null\t\" The command to form up rang  out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards\"\n",
      "null\t\" Still no one moved\"\n",
      "null\t\" The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this  irresolution communicated itself to the men\"\n",
      "null\t\" If only they would be quick! thought Rostv, feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so  often heard from his fellow hussars\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Foward, with God, lads! rang out Densovs voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" At a twot foward!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rook pulled at the  reins and started of his own accord\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before him, on the right, Rostv saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but  took to be the enemy\"\n",
      "null\t\" Shots could be heard, but some way off\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv anticipated his horses movements and became more and more  elated\"\n",
      "null\t\" This tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleand now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but  everything was becoming more and more happy and animated\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, how I  will slash at him! thought Rostv, gripping the hilt of his saber\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hur-a-a-a-ah! came a roar of voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let anyone come my way now, thought Rostv driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go  at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ahead, the enemy was  already visible\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep  over the squadron\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Niktenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rostv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried  forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot\"\n",
      "null\t\" From behind him Bondarchk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked  angrily at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed! Rostv  asked and answered at the same instant\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was alone in the middle of a  field\"\n",
      "null\t\" Instead of the moving horses and hussars backs, he saw nothing  before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him\"\n",
      "null\t\" There  was warm blood under his arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, I am wounded and the horse is  killed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his  riders leg\"\n",
      "null\t\" Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could  not rise\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache  having become entangled in the saddle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where our men were, and where the  French, he did not know\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was no one near\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where, on which side, was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies? he asked himself  and could not answer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Can something bad have happened to me? he wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something  superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" The wrist felt as if  it were not his\"\n",
      "null\t\" He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find  blood on it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, here are people coming, he thought joyfully,  seeing some men running toward him\"\n",
      "null\t\" They will help me! In front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned,  and with a hooked nose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then came two more, and many more running  behind\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of them said something strange, not in Russian\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It must be one of ours, a prisoner\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Can they be French? He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful  that he could not believe his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who are they? Why are they running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone is so fond of? He remembered his mothers love for him, and his familys, and his friends, and the enemys intention to kill him  seemed impossible\"\n",
      "null\t\" But perhaps they may do it! For more than ten  seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation\"\n",
      "null\t\" The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so  close that the expression of his face could be seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath,  and running so lightly, frightened Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his  might toward the bushes\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the  feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds\"\n",
      "null\t\" One single sentiment, that  of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale,  young face to look back\"\n",
      "null\t\" A shudder of terror went through him: No, better not look, he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced  round once more\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted  something loudly to a comrade farther back\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv paused\"\n",
      "null\t\" They cant have wanted to  kill me\"\n",
      "null\t\" But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if  a seventy-pound weight were tied to it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  Frenchman also stopped and took aim\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv closed his eyes and stooped  down\"\n",
      "null\t\" One bullet and then another whistled past him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and  retreated as a disorderly crowd\"\n",
      "null\t\" One soldier, in his fear, uttered the senseless cry, Cut off! that is so terrible in battle, and that  word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Surrounded! Cut off? Were lost! shouted the fugitives\"\n",
      "null\t\" The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years service who had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately  missed him\"\n",
      "null\t\" His one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two years service, who had never been  censured, should not be held to blame\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and  descending the valley\"\n",
      "null\t\" That moment of moral hesitation which decides  the fate of battles had arrived\"\n",
      "null\t\" Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him, continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the  air, and disobeying orders\"\n",
      "null\t\" The moral hesitation which decided the fate  of battles was evidently culminating in a panic\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the  powder smoke and stopped in despair\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything seemed lost\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was Timkhins company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having  lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Timkhin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by  surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov, running beside Timkhin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was  the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our fugitives returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had  nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our  reserve units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regimental commander and Major Ekonmov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up  and took hold of the commanders stirrup, almost leaning against him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition  pouch was slung\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commanders face,  and his lips were smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonmov, he could not help taking notice of the  soldier\"\n",
      "null\t\" Your excellency, here are two trophies, said Dlokhov, pointing  to the French sword and pouch\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have taken an officer prisoner\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov breathed heavily from weariness and  spoke in abrupt sentences\"\n",
      "null\t\" The whole company can bear witness\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Dlokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his  head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A bayonet wound\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshins battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did Prince Bagratin, still hearing the cannonade in the center, send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order  the battery to retire as quickly as possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the supports attached to Tshins battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someones order, the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended  guns\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose that herein the centerthe main Russian forces  were concentrated\"\n",
      "null\t\" Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated  guns on the hillock\"\n",
      "null\t\" Soon after Prince Bagratin had left him, Tshin had succeeded in  setting fire to Schn Grabern\"\n",
      "null\t\" Look at them scurrying! Its burning! Just see the smoke! Fine! Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke! exclaimed the artillerymen,  brightening up\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the  direction of the conflagration\"\n",
      "null\t\" As if urging each other on, the soldiers  cried at each shot: Fine! Thats good! Look at it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Grand! The  fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French columns that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village  and began firing them at Tshins battery\"\n",
      "null\t\" In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon  drivers leg\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished,  but only changed character\"\n",
      "null\t\" The horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns  were turned against the ten-gun battery\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshins companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled, but  the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever\"\n",
      "null\t\" Twice they noticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot  at them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Little Tshin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to refill my pipe for that one! and then, scattering sparks from it,  ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French\"\n",
      "null\t\" Smack at em, lads! he kept saying, seizing the guns by the  wheels and working the screws himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump, Tshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his  feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face grew more and  more animated\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always  the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officerall looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably  reflected on theirs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity, Tshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never  occurred to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the contrary, he became more and more elated\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though he thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to  feverish delirium or drunkenness\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and thud of the enemys cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys side (always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded  him pleasure\"\n",
      "null\t\" The enemys guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes  from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There\"\n",
      "null\t\" hes puffing again, muttered Tshin to himself, as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by  the wind\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Now look out for the ball\"\n",
      "null\t\" well throw it back\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" only a shell\"\n",
      "null\t\" Matvvna * was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which  was large and of an old pattern\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French swarming round their guns  seemed to him like ants\"\n",
      "null\t\" In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second guns crew was uncle; Tshin looked at him more  often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now  increasing, seemed like someones breathing\"\n",
      "null\t\" He listened intently to  the ebb and flow of these sounds\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * Daughter of Matthew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah! Breathing again, breathing! he muttered to himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing  cannon balls at the French with both hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now then, Matvvna, dear old lady, dont let me down! he was saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called above his head: Captain Tshin! Captain!\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the staff officer who had turned  him out of the booth at Grunth\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was shouting in a gasping voice:\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why are they down on me? thought Tshin, looking in alarm at his  superior\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I\"\n",
      "null\t\" he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say\"\n",
      "null\t\" A cannon  ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball  stopped him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He turned his horse and galloped off\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The soldiers laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\" A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same  order\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It was Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" The first thing he saw on riding up to the space where Tshins guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a  broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring\"\n",
      "null\t\" Among the limbers lay  several dead men\"\n",
      "null\t\" One ball after another passed over as he approached  and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the mere thought  of being afraid roused him again\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cannot be afraid, thought he,  and dismounted slowly among the guns\"\n",
      "null\t\" He delivered the order and did  not leave the battery\"\n",
      "null\t\" He decided to have the guns removed from their  positions and withdrawn in his presence\"\n",
      "null\t\" Together with Tshin, stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended  to the removal of the guns\"\n",
      "null\t\" A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off, said an  artilleryman to Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not like your honor!\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were both so busy as to seem  not to notice one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" When having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode  up to Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, till we meet again\"\n",
      "null\t\" he said, holding out his hand to  Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Good-by, my dear fellow, said Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dear soul! Good-by, my dear fellow! and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his  eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,  hung low over the field of battle on the horizon\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was growing  dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous\"\n",
      "null\t\" The cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the  right sounded oftener and nearer\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as Tshin with his guns, continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff, among them the staff officer and Zherkv, who had been twice sent to  Tshins battery but had never reached it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Interrupting one another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed,  reprimanding and reproaching him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshin gave no orders, and, silentlyfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to  weep without knowing whyrode behind on his artillery nag\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves  after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages\"\n",
      "null\t\" The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tshins wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on  Matvvnas carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to Tshin and asked  for a seat\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Captain, for Gods sake! Ive hurt my arm, he said timidly\"\n",
      "null\t\" For Gods sake\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and  been refused\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tell them to give me a seat, for Gods sake!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lay a cloak for him to sit on,  lad, he said, addressing his favorite soldier\"\n",
      "null\t\" And where is the wounded officer?\"\n",
      "null\t\" He died, replied someone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,  Antnov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The cadet was Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" With one hand he supported the other; he was  pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was placed on  Matvvna, the gun from which they had removed the dead officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his  breeches and arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" What, are you wounded, my lad? said Tshin, approaching the gun  on which Rostv sat\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, its a sprain\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Then what is this blood on the gun carriage? inquired Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the officer, your honor, stained it, answered the artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if  apologizing for the state of his gun\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the  infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted\"\n",
      "null\t\" It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces  off, and the firing had begun to subside\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly, near by on the  right, shouting and firing were again heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Flashes of shot gleamed in  the darkness\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers  who had sheltered in the village houses\"\n",
      "null\t\" They all rushed out of the village again, but Tshins guns could not move, and the artillerymen, Tshin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they  awaited their fate\"\n",
      "null\t\" The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly,  streamed out of a side street\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Not hurt, Petrv? asked one\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weve given it em hot, mate! They wont make another push  now, said another\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You couldnt see a thing\"\n",
      "null\t\" How they shot at their own fellows!  Nothing could be seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pitch-dark, brother! Isnt there something to drink?\"\n",
      "null\t\" And again and again in the complete darkness Tshins guns moved forward, surrounded by the  humming infantry as by a frame\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of  hoofs and wheels\"\n",
      "null\t\" Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness  of the night\"\n",
      "null\t\" The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their  groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night\"\n",
      "null\t\" After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing: What did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us? came  eager questions from all sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt:  evidently those in front had halted\"\n",
      "null\t\" All remained where they were in the  middle of the muddy road\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible\"\n",
      "null\t\" Captain Tshin, having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the  soldiers had kindled on the road\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, too, dragged himself to the  fire\"\n",
      "null\t\" From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole  body\"\n",
      "null\t\" Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory  position\"\n",
      "null\t\" He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered  figure of Tshin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshins large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rostv, who saw that Tshin with his whole heart  wished to help him but could not\"\n",
      "null\t\" From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who  were walking, driving past, and settling down all around\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses hoofs moving in mud, the  crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the  gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and  around him\"\n",
      "null\t\" An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held  his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You dont mind your honor? he asked Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ive lost my  company, your honor\"\n",
      "null\t\" such bad luck!\"\n",
      "null\t\" After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to  the campfire\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying  to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You picked it up?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dare say! Youre very smart! one of them  shouted hoarsely\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg  band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Must one die like a dog? said he\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Tshin told them to give the man some water\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then a cheerful soldier  ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry\"\n",
      "null\t\" A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow  countrymen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thanks for the firewell return it with interest,  said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed  by the fire\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of them stumbled\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hes deadwhy carry him? said another\"\n",
      "null\t\" Shut up!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Still aching? Tshin asked Rostv in a whisper\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Your honor, youre wanted by the general\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is in the hut here,  said a gunner, coming up to Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Coming, friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight,  walked away from the fire\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for him, Prince Bagratin sat at dinner, talking with some commanding  officers who had gathered at his quarters\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherkv, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew,  pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and the accountant with the nave face was feeling its texture, shaking his head in perplexityperhaps because the banner really interested him, perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at  a dinner where there was no place for him\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the next hut there was a  French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our officers  were flocking in to look at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our  losses\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and  had broken up the French troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: Ill let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalionand  thats what I did\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed  to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I saw the Pvlograd hussars attack there, your excellency, chimed  in Zherkv, looking uneasily around\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had not seen the hussars all  that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" They  broke up two squares, your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several of those present smiled at Zherkvs words, expecting one of his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the days work, they assumed a serious expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie  devoid of any foundation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin turned to the old colonel:\"\n",
      "null\t\" How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center? he inquired, searching with his eyes for  someone\"\n",
      "null\t\" (Prince Bagratin did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very  beginning of the action\"\n",
      "null\t\") I think I sent you? he added, turning to  the staff officer on duty\"\n",
      "null\t\" One was damaged, answered the staff officer, and the other I  cant understand\"\n",
      "null\t\" I was there all the time giving orders and had only  just left\"\n",
      "null\t\" Someone mentioned that Captain Tshin was bivouacking close to the  village and had already been sent for\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, but you were there? said Prince Bagratin, addressing Prince  Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of course, we only just missed one another, said the staff  officer, with a smile to Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" I had not the pleasure of seeing you, said Prince Andrew, coldly  and abruptly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All were silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshin appeared at the threshold and made his way  timidly from behind the backs of the generals\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and  stumbled over it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several of those present laughed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present  themselves to Tshin in all their horror\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had been so excited that  he had not thought about it until that moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officers laughter  confused him still more\"\n",
      "null\t\" He stood before Bagratin with his lower  jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: I dont know\"\n",
      "null\t\" your  excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that  was perfectly true\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagratin as a schoolboy who  has blundered looks at an examiner\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The silence lasted some time\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin, apparently not wishing to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to  intervene\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew looked at Tshin from under his brows and his  fingers twitched nervously\"\n",
      "null\t\" Your excellency! Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt  voice, you were pleased to send me to Captain Tshins battery\"\n",
      "null\t\" I went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two  guns smashed, and no supports at all\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin and Tshin looked with equal intentness at  Bolknski, who spoke with suppressed agitation\"\n",
      "null\t\" And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion, he continued, we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tshin and his company,  and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin looked at Tshin, evidently reluctant to show distrust in Bolknskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully  to credit it, bent his head, and told Tshin that he could go\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince  Andrew went out with him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow! said Tshin\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt  sad and depressed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will all this end? thought Rostv, looking at the changing shadows before  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The pain in his arm became more and more intense\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was they, these soldierswounded and unwoundedit was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting  the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder\"\n",
      "null\t\" To  rid himself of them he closed his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand, Snyas thin little shoulders, Natshas eyes and laughter, Densov with his voice and mustache, and Telynin and all that affair  with Telynin and Bogdnich\"\n",
      "null\t\" That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and  always dragging it in one direction\"\n",
      "null\t\" He tried to get away from them, but  they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairs breadth\"\n",
      "null\t\" It would not acheit would be wellif only they did not pull it, but  it was impossible to get rid of them\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He opened his eyes and looked up\"\n",
      "null\t\" The black canopy of night hung less  than a yard above the glow of the charcoal\"\n",
      "null\t\" Flakes of falling snow were  fluttering in that light\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tshin had not returned, the doctor had not  come\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at  the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Nobody wants me! thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is no one to help me or  pity me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved\"\n",
      "null\t\" Eh, is anything hurting you? asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added: What a lot of men have been crippled todayfrightful!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm, bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his  healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why  did I come here? he wondered\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of  Bagratins detachment was reunited to Kutzovs army\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER I\"\n",
      "null\t\" Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had  become a habit\"\n",
      "null\t\" Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life, were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the  circumstances and persons he met\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,  some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not, for instance, say to himself: This man now has influence, I must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special  grant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nor did he say to himself: Pierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles  I need\"\n",
      "null\t\" But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince Vasli took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his  request\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to  Petersburg and staying at his house\"\n",
      "null\t\" With apparent absent-mindedness, yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing,  Prince Vasli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both  above and below him in social standing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in  seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezkhov and a rich man, felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and  preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had to sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended  and grieved had he chosen not to see them\"\n",
      "null\t\" These different peoplebusinessmen, relations, and acquaintances alikewere all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierres noble  qualities\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was always hearing such words as: With your remarkable kindness, or, With your excellent heart, You are yourself so honorable, Count, or, Were he as clever as you, and so on, till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it  had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent\"\n",
      "null\t\" Even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently  unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate\"\n",
      "null\t\" The angry eldest princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a dolls,  had come into Pierres room after the funeral\"\n",
      "null\t\" With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received, to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where  she had sacrificed so much\"\n",
      "null\t\" She could not refrain from weeping at these  words\"\n",
      "null\t\" Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre  took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for\"\n",
      "null\t\" From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began  knitting a striped scarf for him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased, said Prince Vasli to him, handing him  a deed to sign for the princess benefit\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bonea bill for thirty thousand rublesto the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of  the inlaid portfolio\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess  grew still kinder\"\n",
      "null\t\" The younger sisters also became affectionate to him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made  him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could  not but believe in the sincerity of those around him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides, he had  no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful  intoxication\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he did this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of  him, but still that happy result always remained in the future\"\n",
      "null\t\" More than anyone else, Prince Vasli took possession of Pierres  affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the death of  Count Bezkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had the air of a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for pitys sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice  of fate and the designs of rogues\"\n",
      "null\t\" During the few days he spent in Moscow after the death of Count Bezkhov, he would call Pierre, or go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I  propose is the only thing possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last, said Prince Vasli one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierres elbow, speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed  upon and could not now be altered\"\n",
      "null\t\" We start tomorrow and Im giving  you a place in my carriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am very glad\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here is  something I have received from the chancellor\"\n",
      "null\t\" I asked him for you, and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of  the Bedchamber\"\n",
      "null\t\" The diplomatic career now lies open before you\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Prince Vasli interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was  needed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,  and there is nothing to thank me for\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one has ever complained yet of being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it  up tomorrow\"\n",
      "null\t\" But you will see everything for yourself when you get to  Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is high time for you to get away from these terrible  recollections\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, yes, my boy\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I have received what was due from the Ryazn estate and will keep it;  you wont require it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well go into the accounts later\"\n",
      "null\t\" In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of  gentleness and affection\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could not refuse the post, or rather the rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasli had procured for him, and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never  attained\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Guards had gone to the front; Dlokhov had been reduced to the ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with  a friend older than himself and whom he respected\"\n",
      "null\t\" His whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vaslis house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and  his beautiful daughter Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Like the others, Anna Pvlovna Schrer showed Pierre the change of  attitude toward him that had taken place in society\"\n",
      "null\t\" Formerly in Anna Pvlovnas presence, Pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolytes  stupidest remarks came out clever and apt\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now everything Pierre said  was charmant\"\n",
      "null\t\" Even if Anna Pvlovna did not say so, he could see that  she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna Pvlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added: You will find the beautiful Hlne here, whom it is always  delightful to see\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and Hlne, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an  entertaining supposition\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovnas At Home was like the former one, only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexanders visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold  the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the young mans recent loss by the death of Count Bezkhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention  of her most august Majesty the Empress Mrya Fdorovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre felt  flattered by this\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Pvlovna arranged the different groups in her  drawing room with her habitual skill\"\n",
      "null\t\" The large group, in which were  Prince Vasli and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another group was at the tea table\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna Pvlovnawho was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in actionseeing Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:\"\n",
      "null\t\" (She glanced at Hlne and smiled at her\"\n",
      "null\t\") My dear Hlne, be  charitable to my poor aunt who adores you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go and keep her company for  ten minutes\"\n",
      "null\t\" And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count  who will not refuse to accompany you\"\n",
      "null\t\" The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pvlovna detained Pierre, looking  as if she had to give some final necessary instructions\"\n",
      "null\t\" Isnt she exquisite? she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately  beauty as she glided away\"\n",
      "null\t\" And how she carries herself! For so young a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from  her heart\"\n",
      "null\t\" Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men  would occupy a most brilliant position in society\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you think so?  I only wanted to know your opinion, and Anna Pvlovna let Pierre go\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Hlnes  perfection of manner\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he ever thought of Hlne, it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in  society\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for Hlne and inclined rather  to show her fear of Anna Pvlovna\"\n",
      "null\t\" She looked at her niece, as if  inquiring what she was to do with these people\"\n",
      "null\t\" On leaving them, Anna Pvlovna again touched Pierres sleeve, saying: I hope you wont  say that it is dull in my house again, and she glanced at Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hlne smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the  possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted\"\n",
      "null\t\" The aunt coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see Hlne, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome  and the same look\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the middle of a dull and halting conversation, Hlne turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave  to everyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little  meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierres  father, Count Bezkhov, and showed them her own box\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Hlne  asked to see the portrait of the aunts husband on the box lid\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is probably the work of Vinesse, said Pierre, mentioning a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the  snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table\"\n",
      "null\t\" He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,  passing it across Hlnes back\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hlne stooped forward to make  room, and looked round with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was, as always at evening parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at  front and back\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that  he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the  creaking of her corset as she moved\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body  only covered by her garments\"\n",
      "null\t\" And having once seen this he could not help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once  seen through\"\n",
      "null\t\" So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am? Hlne  seemed to say\"\n",
      "null\t\" You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a  woman who may belong to anyoneto you too, said her glance\"\n",
      "null\t\" And at that moment Pierre felt that Hlne not only could, but must, be his  wife, and that it could not be otherwise\"\n",
      "null\t\" He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the  altar with her\"\n",
      "null\t\" How and when this would be he did not know, he did not even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why,  that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every  day until then, but he could no longer do it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could not, any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has  once recognized it to be a tuft of grass\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was terribly close to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, I will leave you in your little corner, came Anna  Pvlovnas voice, I see you are all right there\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything  reprehensible, looked round with a blush\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed to him that everyone  knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pvlovna said to him: I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?\"\n",
      "null\t\" The architect had told him that it was necessary, and Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house  done up\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats a good thing, but dont move from Prince Vaslis\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is good to have a friend like the prince, she said, smiling at Prince  Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know something about that\"\n",
      "null\t\" You need advice\"\n",
      "null\t\" She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have  mentioned their age\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you marry it will be a different thing,  she continued, uniting them both in one glance\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre did not look at  Hlne nor she at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  muttered something and colored\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what  had happened\"\n",
      "null\t\" What had happened? Nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But shes stupid\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites  in me\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that thats why  he was sent away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli is her  father\"\n",
      "null\t\" he reflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he had  thought and heard of her might be false\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasli, but visualized her whole body only veiled  by its gray dress\"\n",
      "null\t\" But no! Why did this thought never occur to me before? and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in  this marriage\"\n",
      "null\t\" He recalled her former words and looks and the words  and looks of those who had seen them together\"\n",
      "null\t\" He recalled Anna Pvlovnas words and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasli and others, and was seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do  something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do\"\n",
      "null\t\" But at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another  part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty\"\n",
      "null\t\" In November, 1805, Prince Vasli had to go on a tour of inspection  in four different provinces\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolknski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that  rich old man\"\n",
      "null\t\" But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince Vasli had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince Vaslis house where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in Hlnes presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed  to her\"\n",
      "null\t\" This is all very fine, but things must be settled, said Prince Vasli to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre who was under such obligations to him (But never mind that)  was not behaving very well in this matter\"\n",
      "null\t\" well, God be with him, thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart,  but it must be brought to a head\"\n",
      "null\t\" The day after tomorrow will be  Llyas name day\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will invite two or three people, and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affairyes, my  affair\"\n",
      "null\t\" Six weeks after Anna Pvlovnas At Home and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry Hlne would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not left Prince Vaslis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible  thing he would have to unite his fate with hers\"\n",
      "null\t\" He might perhaps have been able to free himself but that Prince Vasli (who had rarely before given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil  the general pleasure and disappoint everyones expectation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierres hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: Till tomorrow, or, Be in to dinner or I shall not see you, or, I  am staying in for your sake, and so on\"\n",
      "null\t\" And though Prince Vasli, when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierres sake, hardly exchanged a  couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every day he said to himself one and the same thing: It is time I  understood her and made up my mind what she really is\"\n",
      "null\t\" Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent girl, he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistake,  never says anything stupid\"\n",
      "null\t\" She says little, but what she does say is  always clear and simple, so she is not stupid\"\n",
      "null\t\" She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman! He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remarkshowing that it did not interest heror by a silent look and smile which more palpably  than anything else showed Pierre her superiority\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was right in  regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general  smile that usually brightened her face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror  seized him at the thought of that dreadful step\"\n",
      "null\t\" A thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: What am I doing? I need  resolution\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really  possessed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pvlovnas, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire  paralyzed his will\"\n",
      "null\t\" On Hlnes name day, a small party of just their own peopleas  his wife saidmet for supper at Prince Vaslis\"\n",
      "null\t\" All these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young  girl would be decided that evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" The visitors were seated at supper\"\n",
      "null\t\" On either side of her sat the more important guestsan old general and his wife, and Anna Pvlovna  Schrer\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Hlne,  side by side\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli was not having any supper: he went round the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of  the guests\"\n",
      "null\t\" To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark  except to Pierre and Hlne, whose presence he seemed not to notice\"\n",
      "null\t\" He enlivened the whole party\"\n",
      "null\t\" The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the mens epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with  the animated hum of several conversations\"\n",
      "null\t\" At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the  story of the misfortunes of some Mary Vktorovna or other\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the  center of the table, Prince Vasli attracted everybodys attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" With a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesdays meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Sergy Kuzmch Vyazmtinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergy Kuzmch, in which the Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the peoples loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be  worthy of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" This rescript began with the words: Sergy Kuzmch,  From all sides reports reach me, etc\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, and so he never got farther than: Sergy Kuzmch?  asked one of the ladies\"\n",
      "null\t\" Exactly, not a hairs breadth farther, answered Prince Vasli,  laughing, Sergy Kuzmch\"\n",
      "null\t\" From all sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" Poor Vyazmtinov could not get any farther! He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered Sergy he sobbed, Kuz-m-ch, tears, and From all  sides was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther\"\n",
      "null\t\" And again  his handkerchief, and again: Sergy Kuzmch, From all sides,\"\n",
      "null\t\"  and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kuzmch\"\n",
      "null\t\" and then tears, someone repeated  laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont be unkind, cried Anna Pvlovna from her end of the table  holding up a threatening finger\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is such a worthy and excellent  man, our dear Vyazmtinov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Everybody laughed a great deal\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the head of the table, where the honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the  influence of a variety of exciting sensations\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only Pierre and Hlne sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with Sergy Kuzmcha smile of bashfulness at their own  feelings\"\n",
      "null\t\" But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saut, and ices, and however they avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about Sergy Kuzmch, the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was  directed toPierre and Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli mimicked the sobbing of Sergy Kuzmch and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said:  Yes\"\n",
      "null\t\" its getting on, it will all be settled today\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh seemed to say: Yes, theres nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to  be thus boldly, provocatively happy\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what nonsense all this is that I am saying! thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces  of the lovers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats happiness!\"\n",
      "null\t\" And this human feeling  dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was  evidently forced\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful Hlne with her radiant face and at the red, broad,  and happy though uneasy face of Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed as if the very light  of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and  embarrassed him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot  unexpectedly through his mind\"\n",
      "null\t\"  So it is all finished! he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" And how has it all happened? How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself  alone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about\"\n",
      "null\t\" They are all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I  cannot, disappoint them\"\n",
      "null\t\" But how will it be? I do not know, but it will certainly happen! thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling  shoulders close to his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt it awkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered a lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris  possessed of a Helen\"\n",
      "null\t\" But no doubt it always is and must be so!  he consoled himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" And besides, what have I done to bring it about?  How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then there  was nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards  with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her\"\n",
      "null\t\" How did it begin, when did it all come about? And here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her  breathing, her movements, her beauty\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good  fortune\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a  second time\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what  was said\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am asking you when you last heard from Bolknski, repeated  Prince Vasli a third time\"\n",
      "null\t\" How absent-minded you are, my dear  fellow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at  him and Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, what of it, if you all know it? thought  Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" What of it? Its the truth! and he himself smiled his  gentle childlike smile, and Hlne smiled too\"\n",
      "null\t\" When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmtz? repeated Prince Vasli, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a  dispute\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How can one talk or think of such trifles? thought Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, from Olmtz, he answered, with a sigh\"\n",
      "null\t\" After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the  drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave  of Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away,  refusing to let her see them off\"\n",
      "null\t\" The diplomatist preserved a mournful  silence as he left the drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" He pictured the vanity of his  diplomatic career in comparison with Pierres happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old  general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, the  old fool, he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" That Princess Hlne will be beautiful  still when shes fifty\"\n",
      "null\t\" I think I may congratulate you, whispered Anna Pvlovna to the  old princess, kissing her soundly\"\n",
      "null\t\" If I hadnt this headache Id  have stayed longer\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her  daughters happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time  alone with Hlne in the little drawing room where they were sitting\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her,  but had never spoken to her of love\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now he felt that it was inevitable,  but he could not make up his mind to take the final step\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone elses place here  beside Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" This happiness is not for you, some inner voice  whispered to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" This happiness is for those who have not in them  what there is in you\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was  satisfied with the party\"\n",
      "null\t\" She replied in her usual simple manner that  this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were sitting in  the large drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli came up to Pierre with languid  footsteps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli gave him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was  so strange that one could not take it in\"\n",
      "null\t\" But then the expression of severity changed, and he drew Pierres hand downwards, made him sit  down, and smiled affectionately\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, Llya? he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince  Vasli had only acquired by imitating other parents\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And he again turned to Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sergy KuzmchFrom all sides he said, unbuttoning the top  button of his waistcoat\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about Sergy Kuzmch that interested Prince Vasli just then, and  Prince Vasli saw that Pierre knew this\"\n",
      "null\t\" He suddenly muttered  something and went away\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was  disconcerted\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched Pierre: he looked at Hlne and she too seemed disconcerted,  and her look seemed to say: Well, it is your own fault\"\n",
      "null\t\" The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot! thought Pierre, and he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergy Kuzmch, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it  properly\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Prince Vasli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his  wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Marriages are made in heaven, replied the elderly lady\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down  on a sofa in a far corner of the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" He closed his eyes and seemed to  be dozing\"\n",
      "null\t\" His head sank forward and then he roused himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and  indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre and  Hlne still sat talking just as before\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Still the same, she said to her husband\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his  face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went  past the ladies into the little drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" With quick steps he went  joyfully up to Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre  rose in alarm on seeing it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thank God! said Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" My wife has told me everything! (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his  daughter\"\n",
      "null\t\")My dear boy\"\n",
      "null\t\") I loved your father\"\n",
      "null\t\" He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his  malodorous mouth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tears actually moistened his cheeks\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The old princess came in and also wept\"\n",
      "null\t\" The elderly lady was using  her handkerchief too\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful  Hlnes hand several times\"\n",
      "null\t\" After a while they were left alone  again\"\n",
      "null\t\" All this had to be and could not be otherwise, thought Pierre,  so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is good because  its definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful  bosom as it rose and fell\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hlne! he said aloud and paused\"\n",
      "null\t\" Something special is always said in such cases, he thought, but  could not remember what it was that people say\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked at her face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her face flushed\"\n",
      "null\t\" those\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and  inquiring look\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his  lips and met them with her own\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,  unpleasantly excited expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is too late now, its done; besides I love her, thought  Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Je vous aime! * he said, remembering what has to be said at such  moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * I love you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezkhovs large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people  said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money\"\n",
      "null\t\" Old Prince Nicholas Bolknski received a letter from Prince Vasli in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him  a visit\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at  the same time, my honored benefactor, wrote Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" My son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his  father, he feels for you\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are coming to us of their own accord, incautiously remarked the little  princess on hearing the news\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" A fortnight after the letter Prince Vaslis servants came one  evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day\"\n",
      "null\t\" Old Bolknski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vaslis character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and  Alexander Prince Vasli had risen to high position and honors\"\n",
      "null\t\" And now, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess, he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into  a feeling of contemptuous ill will\"\n",
      "null\t\" He snorted whenever he mentioned  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the day of Prince Vaslis arrival, Prince Bolknski was  particularly discontented and out of temper\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vasli was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vaslis visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morning Tkhon had already advised the  architect not to go to the prince with his report\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you hear how hes walking? said Tkhon, drawing the  architects attention to the sound of the princes footsteps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Stepping flat on his heelswe know what that means\"\n",
      "null\t\" However, at nine oclock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable  collar and cap, went out for his usual walk\"\n",
      "null\t\" It had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the  soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince went through the conservatories, the serfs quarters, and the outbuildings,  frowning and silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" Can a sleigh pass? he asked his overseer, a venerable man, resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him  back to the house\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The snow is deep\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am having the avenue swept, your honor\"\n",
      "null\t\" God be thanked, thought the overseer, the storm has blown over!\"\n",
      "null\t\" I  heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,  frowning\"\n",
      "null\t\" What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders? he said in  his shrill, harsh voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" The road is not swept for the princess my daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!\"\n",
      "null\t\" You thought! shouted the prince, his words coming more and more  rapidly and indistinctly\"\n",
      "null\t\" You thought!\"\n",
      "null\t\" shouted the prince  rapidly\"\n",
      "null\t\" But although Alptych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued  to shout: Blackguards!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Throw the snow back on the road! did not  lift his stick again but hurried into the house\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle Bourienne with a radiant face that said: I know nothing, I am the same as usual, and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast  eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions  she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not\"\n",
      "null\t\" She thought: If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will  say (as he has done before) that Im in the dumps\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The prince looked at his daughters frightened face and snorted\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Fool\"\n",
      "null\t\" or dummy! he muttered\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyve been telling tales, he thoughtreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining  room\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Where is the princess? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is not very well, answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with  a bright smile, so she wont come down\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is natural in her  state\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hm! Hm! muttered the prince, sitting down\"\n",
      "null\t\" His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he  flung it away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tkhon caught it and handed it to a footman\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am afraid for the baby, she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:  Heaven knows what a fright might do\"\n",
      "null\t\" In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not  realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt  for her\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her  about the old prince and criticized him\"\n",
      "null\t\" So we are to have visitors, mon prince? remarked Mademoiselle  Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers\"\n",
      "null\t\" His Excellency Prince Vasli Kurgin and his son, I understand? she  said inquiringly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hm!his excellency is a puppy\"\n",
      "null\t\" I got him his appointment in the  service, said the prince disdainfully\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why his son is coming I  dont understand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know\"\n",
      "null\t\") Are you unwell today? Eh? Afraid of the minister as that idiot Alptych called him this morning?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and  after the soup the prince became more genial\"\n",
      "null\t\"  After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess  was sitting at a small table, chattering with Msha, her maid\"\n",
      "null\t\" She grew  pale on seeing her father-in-law\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She was much altered\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was now plain rather than pretty\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I feel a kind of oppression, she said in reply to the  princes question as to how she felt\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you want anything?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, all right, all right\"\n",
      "null\t\" He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alptych stood with  bowed head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Has the snow been shoveled back?\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was only  my stupidity\"\n",
      "null\t\" All right, all right, interrupted the prince, and laughing his unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alptych to kiss, and then  proceeded to his study\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli arrived that evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to  one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his  large and handsome eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" He regarded his whole life as a continual round  of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly  heiress in the same way\"\n",
      "null\t\" All this might, he thought, turn out very well  and amusingly\"\n",
      "null\t\" And why not marry her if she really has so much money?  That never does any harm, thought Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\" He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his fathers room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vaslis two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter  entered, as if to say: Yes, thats how I want you to look\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous? Anatole asked, as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been  mentioned during the journey\"\n",
      "null\t\" Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious  with the old prince\"\n",
      "null\t\"  If he starts a row Ill go away, said Prince Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cant bear those old men! Eh?\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had  been minutely described\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,  vainly trying to master her agitation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never  happen! she said, looking at herself in the glass\"\n",
      "null\t\" How shall I enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I cant now be myself with  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having received this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess  Marys room\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know theyve come, Marie? said the little princess, waddling  in, and sinking heavily into an armchair\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,  but had on one of her best dresses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her hair was carefully done and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded  outlines\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still  more noticeable how much plainer she had become\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some unobtrusive touch had been added to Mademoiselle Bouriennes toilet which rendered her  fresh and pretty face yet more attractive\"\n",
      "null\t\" What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess? she  began\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Marys self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her companions not having the least conception that it could be  otherwise\"\n",
      "null\t\" To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to  dress her would prolong their banter and insistence\"\n",
      "null\t\" She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she  submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both these women  quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity, and with the nave and firm conviction  women have that dress can make a face pretty\"\n",
      "null\t\" No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty, said Lise, looking  sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have a maroon  dress, have it fetched\"\n",
      "null\t\" Really! You know the fate of your whole life may  be at stake\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on  the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well\"\n",
      "null\t\" They forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it  would still remain piteous and plain\"\n",
      "null\t\" After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her  with her head bent first on one side and then on the other\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, it will not do, she said decidedly, clasping her hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" No,  Mary, really this dress does not suit you\"\n",
      "null\t\" I prefer you in your little  gray everyday dress\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now please, do it for my sake\"\n",
      "null\t\" But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst  into sobs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come, dear princess, said Mademoiselle Bourienne, just one more  little effort\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess  Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, now well arrange something quite simple and becoming, she  said\"\n",
      "null\t\" The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bouriennes, and Katies, who was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping  of birds\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, leave me alone, said Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds  was silenced at once\"\n",
      "null\t\" They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at  them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist\"\n",
      "null\t\"  At least, change your coiffure, said the little princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Didnt I tell you, she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne, Marys is a face which such a coiffure does  not suit in the least\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not in the least! Please change it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,  but it was too late\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was looking at them with an expression they  both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad\"\n",
      "null\t\" This expression in Princess Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to  be shaken in her determination\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You will change it, wont you? said Lise\"\n",
      "null\t\" And as Princess Mary  gave no answer, she left the room\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Princess Mary was left alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" She did not comply with Lises request, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her  glass\"\n",
      "null\t\" Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and  pondered\"\n",
      "null\t\" A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different  happy world of his own\"\n",
      "null\t\" She fancied a child, her ownsuch as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurses daughterat her own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the  child\"\n",
      "null\t\" But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly, she thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince will be out in a moment, came the  maids voice at the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a  lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments\"\n",
      "null\t\" A painful  doubt filled her soul\"\n",
      "null\t\" Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing  was for earthly love\"\n",
      "null\t\" The more she tried to hide this feeling from  others and even from herself, the stronger it grew\"\n",
      "null\t\" O God, she said, how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will? And scarcely had she put that question than God  gave her the answer in her own heart\"\n",
      "null\t\" Desire nothing for thyself,  seek nothing, be not anxious or envious\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mans future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for  anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" If it be Gods will to prove thee in the duties of marriage,  be ready to fulfill His will\"\n",
      "null\t\" With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what  she would say\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasli and his son were already in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle  Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\" When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said: Voil Marie! Princess Mary  saw them all and saw them in detail\"\n",
      "null\t\" She saw Prince Vaslis face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression  Marie produced on the visitors\"\n",
      "null\t\" And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she  entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli approached first, and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by  saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then  Anatole came up to her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She still could not see him\"\n",
      "null\t\" When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without  speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable  self-possession\"\n",
      "null\t\" If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is  bad\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the  princess hair\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that he could be silent in this way for  a very long time\"\n",
      "null\t\" If anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him  talk, but I dont want to, he seemed to say\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even lovea supercilious consciousness of  his own superiority\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was as if he said to them: I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? Youd be only too glad, of  course\"\n",
      "null\t\" Perhaps he did not really think this when he met womeneven probably he did not, for in general he thought very littlebut his  looks and manner gave that impression\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him,  she turned to his father\"\n",
      "null\t\" The conversation was general and animated, thanks to Princess Lises voice and little downy lip that lifted over  her white teeth\"\n",
      "null\t\" She met Prince Vasli with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though  no such reminiscences really existjust as none existed in this case\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of  things that had never occurred\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these  merry reminiscences\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves, dear prince, said the little princess (of course, in  French) to Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its not as at Annettes * receptions where you always ran away; you remember cette chre Annette!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why is it you were never at Annettes? the little princess asked  Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, I know, I know, she said with a sly glance, your  brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh! and she shook her finger at him, I have even heard of your doings in Paris!\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the  opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections\"\n",
      "null\t\" She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole  had left Paris and how he had liked that city\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her  about her native land\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole  came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not at all bad! he thought, examining her, not at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when were  married, la petite est gentille\"\n",
      "null\t\" *\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering  what he was to do\"\n",
      "null\t\" What are Prince Vasli and that son of his to me? Prince Vasli is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen, he grumbled to  himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about  which he always deceived himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" The question was whether he could ever  bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband\"\n",
      "null\t\" The prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only  with his feelings but with the very possibility of life\"\n",
      "null\t\" Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" To be unhappy for  certain\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theres Lise, married to Andrewa better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadaysbut is she contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! Theyll  take her for her connections and wealth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it? So thought Prince Bolknski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded  an immediate answer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask  for an answer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, Ive nothing against it, the prince said to himself, but he must  be worthy of her\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see! he added  aloud\"\n",
      "null\t\" He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly  round the company\"\n",
      "null\t\" He noticed the change in the little princess dress, Mademoiselle Bouriennes ribbon, Princess Marys unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bouriennes and Anatoles smiles, and the  loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Got herself  up like a fool! he thought, looking irritably at her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is shameless, and he ignores her!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well! How dye do? How dye do? Glad to see you!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here is my second son; please  love and befriend him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Bolknski surveyed Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow! he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, come and  kiss me, and he offered his cheek\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had  told him to expect\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bolknski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasli, pointed to it and began  questioning him about political affairs and news\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vasli said, but kept glancing at Princess  Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" And so they are writing from Potsdam already? he said, repeating  Prince Vaslis last words\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then rising, he suddenly went up to his  daughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is it for visitors youve got yourself up like that, eh? said  he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are  never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was my fault, mon pre, interceded the little princess, with a  blush\"\n",
      "null\t\" You must do as you please, said Prince Bolknski, bowing to his daughter-in-law, but she need not make a fool of herself, shes  plain enough as it is\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was  reduced to tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well, said  Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now you, young prince, whats your name? said Prince Bolknski,  turning to Anatole, come here, let us talk and get acquainted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now the fun begins, thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile  beside the old prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, my dear boy, I hear youve been educated abroad, not taught  to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards? asked the old man,  scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, I have been transferred to the line, said Anatole, hardly able  to restrain his laughter\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah! Thats a good thing\"\n",
      "null\t\" So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the  Tsar and the country? It is wartime\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, are you off to the front?\"\n",
      "null\t\" what is it I am attached to, Papa? said Anatole, turning to his  father with a laugh\"\n",
      "null\t\" A splendid soldier, splendid! What am I attached to! Ha, ha,  ha! laughed Prince Bolknski, and Anatole laughed still louder\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly Prince Bolknski frowned\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You may go, he said to Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anatole returned smiling to the ladies\"\n",
      "null\t\" And so youve had him educated abroad, Prince Vasli, havent  you? said the old prince to Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there  is much better than ours\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  lads a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now\"\n",
      "null\t\" He took  Prince Vaslis arm and led him to his study\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as they were alone together, Prince Vasli announced his hopes and wishes to the old  prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I cant part from  her? said the old prince angrily\"\n",
      "null\t\" What an idea! Im ready for it  tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know my principleseverything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in  your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on\"\n",
      "null\t\" He can stay and  Ill see\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince snorted\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will tell you frankly, said Prince Vasli in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so  keen-sighted a companion\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, you see right through people\"\n",
      "null\t\" As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society, on Anatoles appearance all the three women of Prince Bolknskis household felt that their life had not been real  till then\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in  darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure\"\n",
      "null\t\" The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed  all her attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and  magnanimous\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thousands of dreams of a future  family life continually rose in her imagination\"\n",
      "null\t\" She drove them away and  tried to conceal them\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But am I not too cold with him? thought the princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" I try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine  that I do not like him\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new  guest\"\n",
      "null\t\" Poor girl, shes devilish ugly! thought Anatole\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolknski, to reading  aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her  off; and here at last was a Russian prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she  liked to repeat to herself\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mre) appeared, and  reproached her for yielding to a man without being married\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this  story to him, her seducer\"\n",
      "null\t\" And now he, a real Russian prince, had  appeared\"\n",
      "null\t\" He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mre would appear  and he would marry her\"\n",
      "null\t\" So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bouriennes head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about  Paris\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around  him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any  struggle, but with nave and lighthearted gaiety\"\n",
      "null\t\" Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the  spectacle of his power over these three women\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides that, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great  suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions\"\n",
      "null\t\" After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was  asked to play on the clavichord\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle  Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Anatoles expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bouriennes little  foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new  to the princess\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How she loves me! thought Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" How happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it be possible? she thought, not daring to look at his face, but  still feeling his eyes gazing at her\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole  kissed Princess Marys hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" She did not know how she found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near  to her shortsighted eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Turning from Princess Mary he went up and  kissed Mademoiselle Bouriennes hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" (This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle  Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What delicacy! thought the princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is it possible that Amlie (Mademoiselle Bourienne) thinks I could be jealous of her, and not value her pure affection and devotion to me? She went up  to her and kissed her warmly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole went up to kiss the little  princess hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving  well I will give you my hand to kiss\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not till then! she said\"\n",
      "null\t\" They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he  got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kindyes, kind, that is the chief thing, thought Princess Mary; and fear, which  she had seldom experienced, came upon her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She feared to look round, it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the  dark corner\"\n",
      "null\t\" And this someone was hethe deviland he was also this  man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mre  rebuking her for her fall\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made\"\n",
      "null\t\" She could not lie either on her face or on her side\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every position was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because Anatoles presence had vividly recalled to her the time  when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay\"\n",
      "null\t\" She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third  time, muttering to herself\"\n",
      "null\t\" I told you it was all lumps and holes! the little princess  repeated\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so its not my  fault! and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The old prince did not sleep either\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tkhon, half asleep, heard him  pacing angrily about and snorting\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince felt as though he  had been insulted through his daughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" The insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he  loved more than himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but  instead of that he only excited himself more and more\"\n",
      "null\t\" The first man that turns upshe forgets her father and everything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" fr! And dont I see that that idiot had eyes only for  BourienneI shall have to get rid of her\"\n",
      "null\t\" And how is it she has not pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks  nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\" but  Ill let her see\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Marys self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this  thought, he called Tkhon and began to undress\"\n",
      "null\t\" What devil brought them here? thought he, while Tkhon was  putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest\"\n",
      "null\t\" I never invited them\"\n",
      "null\t\" They came to disturb my lifeand there is not  much of it left\"\n",
      "null\t\" Devil take em! he muttered, while his head was still covered by  the shirt\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tkhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of  the face that emerged from the shirt\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Gone to bed? asked the prince\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tkhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his  masters thoughts\"\n",
      "null\t\" He guessed that the question referred to Prince  Vasli and his son\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No good\"\n",
      "null\t\" said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing  gown, he went to the couch on which he slept\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance, up to the appearance of the pauvre mre; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an  opportunity since morning to meet one another alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Princess Mary went to her fathers room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne  and Anatole met in the conservatory\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be  decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it\"\n",
      "null\t\" She read this in Tkhons face and in that of Prince Vaslis valet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot  water\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of  his daughter that morning\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary well knew this painstaking  expression of her fathers\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,  repeating in a low voice the same words several times over\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have had a proposition made me concerning you, he said with an  unnatural smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasli has not come and brought his pupil with him (for some reason Prince Bolknski referred to Anatole as a pupil) for the sake of my  beautiful eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Last night a proposition was made me on your account  and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you\"\n",
      "null\t\" How am I to understand you, mon pre? said the princess, growing  pale and then blushing\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How understand me! cried her father angrily\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you  on his pupils behalf\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats how its to be understood! How  understand it!\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I ask you!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question\"\n",
      "null\t\" Im not going to  get married\"\n",
      "null\t\" What about you? Thats what I want to know\"\n",
      "null\t\" She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from habit, and she said: I wish only to do your will, but if  I had to express my own desire\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old  prince interrupted her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats admirable! he shouted\"\n",
      "null\t\" He will take you with your  dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain\"\n",
      "null\t\" Shell be the  wife, while you\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The prince stopped\"\n",
      "null\t\" He saw the effect these words had produced on his  daughter\"\n",
      "null\t\" She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" Remember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to  choose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only remember that your lifes happiness  depends on your decision\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theres no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you  or anybody; but you are free to choose\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go to your room, think it  over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know you will pray over it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, pray if you like, but you had better  think it over\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no! he still shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the  study\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Her fate was decided and happily decided\"\n",
      "null\t\" But what her father had said  about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was untrue to be sure, but  still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle  Bourienne aroused her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw  Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her\"\n",
      "null\t\" With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle  Bourienne who had not yet seen her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Whos that? Why? Wait a moment! Anatoles face seemed to say\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary looked at them in silence\"\n",
      "null\t\" She could not understand it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door  that led to his own apartments\"\n",
      "null\t\" An hour later, Tkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince;  he added that Prince Vasli was also there\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Tkhon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping  Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bouriennes  pretty face\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever! said  Mademoiselle Bourienne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why? I love you more than ever, said Princess Mary, and I will  try to do all I can for your happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But you despise me\"\n",
      "null\t\" You who are so pure can never understand being so  carried away by passion\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, only my poor mother\"\n",
      "null\t\" Calm yourself, my dear\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will go to my father, she said, and went  out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Vasli, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as if stirred to his hearts core and himself regretting and laughing  at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered\"\n",
      "null\t\" He hurriedly took a  pinch of snuff\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my dear, my dear! he began, rising and taking her by both  hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then, sighing, he added: My sons fate is in your hands\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Fr\"\n",
      "null\t\" snorted Prince Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kurgins wife? Reply: yes or no, he shouted, and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion  also\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion, added Prince Bolknski,  turning to Prince Vasli and answering his imploring look\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, or no?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont wish to marry, she answered positively,  glancing at Prince Vasli and at her father with her beautiful eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug! cried Prince Bolknski, frowning and taking his daughters hand; he did not kiss her, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so  that she winced and uttered a cry\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Vasli rose\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never  forget\"\n",
      "null\t\" But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching  this heart, so kind and generous? Say perhaps\"\n",
      "null\t\" The future is so  long\"\n",
      "null\t\" Say perhaps\"\n",
      "null\t\" I thank you for  the honor, but I shall never be your sons wife\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, so thats finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have  seen you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Very, very glad to have seen you, repeated he,  embracing Prince Vasli\"\n",
      "null\t\"  My vocation is a different one, thought Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" My vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness  of love and self-sacrifice\"\n",
      "null\t\" And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Amlies happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so  passionately repents\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will do all I can to arrange the match between  them\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my  father and Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might  have done the same!\"\n",
      "null\t\" thought Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sons  handwriting\"\n",
      "null\t\" On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the  letter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house, on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same  time\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still  living with the Rostvs\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear friend? said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared  to sympathize in any way\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The count sobbed yet more\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Niklenka\"\n",
      "null\t\" wounded\"\n",
      "null\t\" the countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" At dinner Anna Mikhylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about Niklenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might  very likely be getting a letter from him that day\"\n",
      "null\t\" Each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikhylovna, the latter very adroitly turned  the conversation to insignificant matters\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, who, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and Anna Mikhylovna, that it had something to do with her  brother, and that Anna Mikhylovna was preparing them for it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bold as she was, Natsha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Niklenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her  chair regardless of her governess remarks\"\n",
      "null\t\" After dinner, she rushed headlong after Anna Mikhylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on  her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I wont give upI know you know  something\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anna Mikhylovna shook her head\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You are a little slyboots, she said\"\n",
      "null\t\" A letter from Niklenka! Im sure of it! exclaimed Natsha,  reading confirmation in Anna Mikhylovnas face\"\n",
      "null\t\" But for Gods sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your  mamma\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will, I will, only tell me! You wont? Then I will go and tell at  once\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter,  on condition that she should tell no one\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, on my true word of honor, said Natsha, crossing herself,  I wont tell anyone! and she ran off at once to Snya\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Niklenka\"\n",
      "null\t\" wounded\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Nicholas! was all Snya said, instantly turning white\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha, seeing the impression the news of her brothers wound produced on Snya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the  news\"\n",
      "null\t\"  She rushed to Snya, hugged her, and began to cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he  wrote himself, said she through her tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" There now! Its true that all you women are crybabies, remarked  Ptya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now Im very  glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are all blubberers and understand nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Natsha smiled through her tears\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You havent read the letter? asked Snya\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, but she said that it was all over and that hes now an  officer\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thank God! said Snya, crossing herself\"\n",
      "null\t\" But perhaps she  deceived you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let us go to Mamma\"\n",
      "null\t\" If Id been in Niklenkas place I would have killed even more  of those Frenchmen, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" What nasty brutes they are! Id  have killed so many that thered have been a heap of them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Im not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles, said  Ptya\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do you remember him? Natsha suddenly asked, after a moments  silence\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Snya smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, Snya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly, remember everything? said Natsha, with an expressive gesture,  evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning\"\n",
      "null\t\" I  remember Niklenka too, I remember him well, she said\"\n",
      "null\t\" But I  dont remember Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont remember him a bit\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its not that I dont rememberI know what he is like, but not  as I remember Niklenka\"\n",
      "null\t\" HimI just shut my eyes and remember,  but Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\") No! theres nothing at  all\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, Natsha! said Snya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was out of the question, I am in love with your brother once for all and, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him  as long as I live\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha looked at Snya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said  nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" She felt that Snya was speaking the truth, that there was  such love as Snya was speaking of\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Natsha had not yet felt  anything like it\"\n",
      "null\t\" She believed it could be, but did not understand it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Snya became thoughtful\"\n",
      "null\t\" The question of how to write to Nicholas, and  whether she ought to write, tormented her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I think if he writes, I will write too, she said,  blushing\"\n",
      "null\t\" And you wont feel ashamed to write to him?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And I should be ashamed to write to Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why should you be ashamed?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its awkward and would make me ashamed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles (that was how Ptya described his namesake, the new Count Bezkhov) and now shes in love with that singer (he meant Natshas Italian singing master), thats why shes ashamed!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not more stupid than you, madam, said the nine-year-old Ptya,  with the air of an old brigadier\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhylovnas hints at dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears  kept coming into her eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, with the letter, came on  tiptoe to the countess door and paused\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dont come in, she said to the old count who was following her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come later\"\n",
      "null\t\" And she went in, closing the door behind her\"\n",
      "null\t\" At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna Mikhylovnas voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence,  then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna opened the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the  public to appreciate his skill\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is done! she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and  in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips\"\n",
      "null\t\" When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away  the bald head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vra, Natsha, Snya, and Ptya now entered the room,  and the reading of the letter began\"\n",
      "null\t\" After a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his fathers and mothers hands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed Vra, Natsha, and  Ptya\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him dear  Snya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever\"\n",
      "null\t\" When she heard this Snya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall, whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon,  and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess was  crying\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why are you crying, Mamma? asked Vra\"\n",
      "null\t\" From all he says one  should be glad and not cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natsha looked  at her reproachfully\"\n",
      "null\t\" And who is it she takes after? thought the  countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she  did not let it out of her hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" The tutors came, and the nurses, and Dmtri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh  proofs of Niklenkas virtues\"\n",
      "null\t\" How strange, how extraordinary, how joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who had first learned to say pear and then granny, that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of mans work of his own, without help or  guidance\"\n",
      "null\t\" The universal experience of ages, showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the  countess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her sons growth toward manhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the  millions of human beings who grew up in the same way\"\n",
      "null\t\" As twenty years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this  letter, he now was\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a style! How charmingly he describes! said she, reading the  descriptive part of the letter\"\n",
      "null\t\" And what a soul! Not a word about  himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not a word! About some Densov or other, though he himself,  I dare say, is braver than any of them\"\n",
      "null\t\" He says nothing about his  sufferings\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered  everybody! Not forgetting anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" I always said when he was only so  highI always said\"\n",
      "null\t\" For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out, while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment  of the newly commissioned officer were collected\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself  and her son\"\n",
      "null\t\" She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand  Duke Constantine Pvlovich, who commanded the Guards\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Rostvs supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address, and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not reach the Pvlograd regiment,  which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood\"\n",
      "null\t\" And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Dukes courier to  Bors and Bors was to forward them to Nicholas\"\n",
      "null\t\" The letters were from the old count, the countess, Ptya, Vra, Natsha, and Snya, and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other  things the old count sent to his son\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the twelfth of November, Kutzovs active army, in camp before Olmtz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperorsthe  Russian and the Austrian\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olmtz and next morning were to come straight  to the review, reaching the field at Olmtz by ten oclock\"\n",
      "null\t\" That day Nicholas Rostv received a letter from Bors, telling him that the Ismylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmtz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after their active service, were stationed near Olmtz and the camp swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering  all sorts of tempting wares\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Pvlograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmtz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian,  who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Densovs horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and  the sutlers\"\n",
      "null\t\" On receiving Bors letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmtz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone  to the Guards camp to find his old playmate\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv had not yet had  time to get his uniform\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a soldiers cross, equally shabby cadets riding breeches lined with  worn leather, and an officers saber with a sword knot\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his  head\"\n",
      "null\t\" As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Bors and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearancethat of a  fighting hussar who had been under fire\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading  their cleanliness and discipline\"\n",
      "null\t\" They had come by easy stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided  excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place\"\n",
      "null\t\" The regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand Dukes orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on which the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their  proper posts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors had been quartered, and had marched all the  way, with Berg who was already in command of a company\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money  matters very satisfactorily\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors, during the campaign, had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolknski, through whom he hoped to  obtain a post on the commander in chiefs staff\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg and Bors, having rested after yesterdays march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them,  playing chess\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Bergs move, and watched his opponents face, evidently thinking about the game as  he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, how are you going to get out of that? he remarked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well try to, replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing  his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\"  At that moment the door opened\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Here he is at last! shouted Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Berg too! Oh, you petisenfans, allay cushay dormir! he exclaimed, imitating his Russian  nurses French, at which he and Bors used to laugh long ago\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dear me, how you have changed!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was about to embrace his  friend, but Nicholas avoided him\"\n",
      "null\t\" With that peculiar feeling of youth, that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas  wished to do something special on meeting his friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wanted to pinch  him, push him, do anything but kiss hima thing everybody did\"\n",
      "null\t\" But notwithstanding this, Bors embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and  kissed him three times\"\n",
      "null\t\" They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young men take their first steps on lifes road, each saw immense changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken  those first steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both had changed greatly since they last met and both  were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if youd been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line, cried Rostv, with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Bors, pointing to his own  mud-bespattered breeches\"\n",
      "null\t\" The German landlady, hearing Rostvs loud  voice, popped her head in at the door\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Eh, is she pretty? he asked with a wink\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why do you shout so? Youll frighten them! said Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" I did  not expect you today, he added\"\n",
      "null\t\" I only sent you the note yesterday  by Bolknskian adjutant of Kutzovs, whos a friend of mine\"\n",
      "null\t\" I did not think he would get it to you so quickly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, how are you?  Been under fire already? asked Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Without answering, Rostv shook the soldiers Cross of St\"\n",
      "null\t\" George fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,  glanced at Berg with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  As you see, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Indeed? Yes, yes! said Bors, with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" And we too have  had a splendid march\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and  every advantage\"\n",
      "null\t\" What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and  balls! I cant tell you\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the Tsarvich was very gracious to all  our officers\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures  and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, you Guards! said Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say, send for some wine\"\n",
      "null\t\"  If you really want it, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent  for wine\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you, he added\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both  arms on the table and began to read\"\n",
      "null\t\" After reading a few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the  letter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, theyve sent you a tidy sum, said Berg, eying the heavy  purse that sank into the sofa\"\n",
      "null\t\" As for us, Count, we get along on our  pay\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say, Berg, my dear fellow, said Rostv, when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with, and I happen to be there, Ill go at once, to  be out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere\"\n",
      "null\t\" to the devil! he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, Dont be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak  from my heart as to an old acquaintance\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, dont mention it, Count! I quite understand, said Berg,  getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Go across to our hosts: they invited you, added Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust, stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having assured himself from the way Rostv looked at it that his coat had been  noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh dear, what a beast I am! muttered Rostv, as he read the  letter\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right lets have some!\"\n",
      "null\t\" What nonsense! Much I need it! said Rostv, throwing the letter  under the table\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why have you thrown that away? asked Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It is some letter of recommendation\"\n",
      "null\t\" what the devil do I want it for!\"\n",
      "null\t\" This letter would be of great use to you\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why not? inquired Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are still the same dreamer, I see, remarked Bors, shaking  his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" And youre still the same diplomatist! But thats not the  point\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come, how are you? asked Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" So far everythings all right, but I confess I  should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, thats it! said Rostv, evidently thinking of something  else\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes, evidently  trying in vain to find the answer to some question\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Old Gabriel brought in the wine\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Shouldnt we now send for Berg? asked Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" He would drink  with you\"\n",
      "null\t\" I cant\"\n",
      "null\t\" and how do you get on with that German?  asked Rostv, with a contemptuous smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow, answered  Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Again Rostv looked intently into Bors eyes and sighed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three  officers became animated\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Guardsmen told Rostv of their march and  how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad\"\n",
      "null\t\" They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told  stories of his kindness and irascibility\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the stories of the Grand Dukes quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of  a movement\"\n",
      "null\t\" With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: Arnauts! (Arnauts was the Tsarvichs favorite expression when he was in  a rage) and called for the company commander\"\n",
      "null\t\" Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew  I was right\"\n",
      "null\t\" Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lords  Prayer\"\n",
      "null\t\" So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and  so my conscience was at ease\"\n",
      "null\t\" I came forward\"\n",
      "null\t\") Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but  rather of death, as the saying is\"\n",
      "null\t\" Albanians! and devils!  and To Siberia! said Berg with a sagacious smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" I knew I  was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hey,  are you dumb? he shouted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Still I remained silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats what keeping ones head means\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, that was fine, said Rostv, smiling\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Bors noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and  skillfully changed the subject\"\n",
      "null\t\" He asked him to tell them how and where  he got his wound\"\n",
      "null\t\" This pleased Rostv and he began talking about it,  and as he went on became more and more animated\"\n",
      "null\t\" He told them of his Schn Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not  at all as it really was\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was a truthful young man and would on  no account have told a deliberate lie\"\n",
      "null\t\" He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily,  and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he had told the truth to his hearerswho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a storythey would either not have believed him or, still worse, would have thought that Rostv was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened  to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as  he could from a Frenchman into the wood\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of  will to tell only what happened\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is very difficult to tell the truth,  and young people are rarely capable of it\"\n",
      "null\t\" His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his  saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on\"\n",
      "null\t\" And so he  told them all that\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: You cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack, Prince  Andrew, whom Bors was expecting, entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Bors, who had managed to please him the  day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having been sent with papers from Kutzov to the Tsarvich, he looked in on Bors,  hoping to find him alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he gave Bors a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at Rostv, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped  in on bad company\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv flushed up on noticing this, but he did not  care, this was a mere stranger\"\n",
      "null\t\" Glancing, however, at Bors, he saw  that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line\"\n",
      "null\t\" In spite of Prince Andrews disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the contempt with which Rostv, from his fighting army point of view, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer  was evidently one, Rostv felt confused, blushed, and became silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without  indiscretion, one might ask about our plans\"\n",
      "null\t\" We shall probably advance, replied Bolknski, evidently reluctant  to say more in the presence of a stranger\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be  doubled\"\n",
      "null\t\" To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed  gaily\"\n",
      "null\t\" As to your business, Prince Andrew continued, addressing Bors,  we will talk of it later (and he looked round at Rostv)\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come  to me after the review and we will do what is possible\"\n",
      "null\t\" I was there, said Rostv angrily, as if intending to insult the  aide-de-camp\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bolknski noticed the hussars state of mind, and it amused him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, stories! repeated Rostv loudly, looking with eyes suddenly  grown furious, now at Bors, now at Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, many stories! But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!\"\n",
      "null\t\" A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mans  self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostvs soul\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am not talking about you, he said, I dont know you and,  frankly, I dont want to\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am speaking of the staff in general\"\n",
      "null\t\" In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and besides, Drubetsky, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to  displease you\"\n",
      "null\t\" However, he added rising, you know my name and where to find me, but dont forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my  advice is to let the matter drop\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well then, on Friday after the review  I shall expect you, Drubetsky\"\n",
      "null\t\" Au revoir! exclaimed Prince Andrew,  and with a bow to them both he went out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostv think of what he ought to  have said\"\n",
      "null\t\" He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Bors, rode  home\"\n",
      "null\t\" Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried  him all the way\"\n",
      "null\t\" He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very  adjutant whom he so hated\"\n",
      "null\t\" The day after Rostv had been to see Bors, a review was held of the Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and  those who had been campaigning under Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" The two Emperors, the Russian with his heir the Tsarvich, and the Austrian with the  Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men\"\n",
      "null\t\" From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up  on the field before the fortress\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers command, turned with banners flying, formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the  infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smoothfelt that no small matter was happening, but an important and  solemn affair\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that  enormous whole\"\n",
      "null\t\" From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten  oclock all had been brought into due order\"\n",
      "null\t\" The ranks were drawn  up on the vast field\"\n",
      "null\t\" The whole army was extended in three lines: the cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the  infantry\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" The three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutzovs fighting army (with the Pvlograds on the right flank of the front); those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the  line; and the Austrian troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" But they all stood in the same lines,  under one command, and in a like order\"\n",
      "null\t\" Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: Theyre coming! Theyre coming! Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final  preparation swept over all the troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" From the direction of Olmtz in front of them, a group was seen  approaching\"\n",
      "null\t\" And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the  lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs\"\n",
      "null\t\" It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its  joy at the approach of the Emperors\"\n",
      "null\t\" One voice was heard shouting: Eyes front! Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was  repeated by others from various sides and all became silent\"\n",
      "null\t\"  In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" This  was the Emperors suites\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the  trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors approach, had naturally burst into  music\"\n",
      "null\t\" Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor  Alexander was clearly heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" He gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared Hurrah! so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the  immensity of the power they constituted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, standing in the front lines of Kutzovs army which the Tsar approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this  triumph\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could  not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! thundered from all sides, one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then  Hurrah!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then the general march, and again Hurrah! Hurrah!  growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar\"\n",
      "null\t\" Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had  already passed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two menthe  Emperors\"\n",
      "null\t\" Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that  whole mass of men was concentrated\"\n",
      "null\t\" The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyones  attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had  recognized the Tsar and watched his approach\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness  and ecstasy such as he had never before known\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every trait and every  movement of the Tsars seemed to him enchanting\"\n",
      "null\t\" Stopping in front of the Pvlograds, the Tsar said something in French  to the Austrian Emperor and smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\" Seeing that smile, Rostv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still  stronger flow of love for his sovereign\"\n",
      "null\t\" He longed to show that love in  some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Tsar  called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?  thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Tsar addressed the officers also: I thank you all, gentlemen, I  thank you with my whole heart\"\n",
      "null\t\" To Rostv every word sounded like a  voice from heaven\"\n",
      "null\t\" How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Georges standards and will be worthy of  them\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, to die, to die for him, thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Tsar said something more which Rostv did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted Hurrah!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided\"\n",
      "null\t\" How can the Emperor be undecided? thought Rostv, but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything  else the Tsar did\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That hesitation lasted only an instant\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Tsars foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he  moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to Rostv from amid the suites  that surrounded the Emperors\"\n",
      "null\t\" Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostv noticed Bolknski, sitting  his horse indolently and carelessly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought  not to challenge Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of course not! he now thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rostv on Bedouin, recently purchased from Densov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadronthat is,  alone and in full view of the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before he reached him, Rostv, who was a splendid horseman, spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the  animal went when excited\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperors eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful  action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but  blissful face like a vewy devil, as Densov expressed it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Fine fellows, the Pvlograds! remarked the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire  this instant! thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also Kutzovs, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the  Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander\"\n",
      "null\t\" His  every word and movement was described with ecstasy\"\n",
      "null\t\" They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the  enemy under the Emperors command\"\n",
      "null\t\" Commanded by the Emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought  Rostv and most of the officers after the review\"\n",
      "null\t\" All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles  would have made them\"\n",
      "null\t\" The day after the review, Bors, in his best uniform and with his comrade Bergs best wishes for success, rode to Olmtz to see Bolknski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some important  personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is all very well for Rostv, whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyones lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of  them! he reflected\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmtz that day, but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and  courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world\"\n",
      "null\t\" He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsmans uniform, all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be  aware of his existence\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the quarters of the commander in chief, Kutzov, where he inquired for Bolknski, all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody  was heartily sick of them\"\n",
      "null\t\" In spite of this, or rather because of it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to Olmtz and,  entering the house occupied by Kutzov, asked for Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew was in and Bors was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of  various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord\"\n",
      "null\t\" One adjutant, nearest  the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another, the red, stout Nesvtski, lay on a bed with his arms under his  head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\" A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on  the clavichord, sang the tune\"\n",
      "null\t\" None of these  gentlemen changed his position on seeing Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" The one who was writing and whom Bors addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolknski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the  reception room if he wished to see him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bors thanked him and went to  the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment), was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldiers obsequious expression on his  purple face, reporting something\"\n",
      "null\t\" Very well, then, be so good as to wait, said Prince Andrew to the general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Bors, Prince Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful  smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment Bors clearly realized what he had before surmised, that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for  his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetsky\"\n",
      "null\t\" More than ever was Bors resolved to serve in future not according to the written  code, but under this unwritten law\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt now that merely by having been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the  Guards\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" I was fussing about  with Germans all day\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Germans start being accurate, theres no end to it!\"\n",
      "null\t\" But it was the first time he had heard  Weyrothers name, or even the term dispositions\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have  been thinking about you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I was thinkingfor some reason Bors could not help  blushingof asking the commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has had a letter from  Prince Kurgin about me\"\n",
      "null\t\" I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards  wont be in action, he added as if in apology\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All right, all right\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well talk it over, replied Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that gentlemanevidently not sharing Bors conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to  say to the adjutant that Bors felt uncomfortable\"\n",
      "null\t\" He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrews return from the commander in  chiefs room\"\n",
      "null\t\" You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you, said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the  clavichord was\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its no use your going to the commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what well do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now  Kutzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything is  now centered round the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" So we will go to Dolgorkov; I have to  go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you\"\n",
      "null\t\" We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you  somewhere nearer the sun\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young  man and help him to worldly success\"\n",
      "null\t\" Under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and  which attracted him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He very readily took up Bors cause and went  with him to Dolgorkov\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmtz  occupied by the Emperors and their retinues\"\n",
      "null\t\" That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of  the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that council, contrary to the views of the old generals Kutzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it  had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte\"\n",
      "null\t\" The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied  by Bors arrived at the palace to find Dolgorkov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the days council, at which  the party of the young had triumphed\"\n",
      "null\t\" The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthe coming battle and the victory that would certainly  result from itno longer seemed to be in the future but in the past\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the advantages were on our side\"\n",
      "null\t\" Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleons, were concentrated in one place, the troops  inspired by the Emperors presence were eager for action\"\n",
      "null\t\" The strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte,  evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dolgorkov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud  of the victory that had been gained\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew introduced his protg, but Prince Dolgorkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Bors and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew  in French\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear fellow, he said abruptly and eagerly, I must confess to having  been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother\"\n",
      "null\t\" What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones  could have been devised\"\n",
      "null\t\" This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valorwhat more could be wished for?\"\n",
      "null\t\" And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him  today for the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dolgorkov smiled significantly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on\"\n",
      "null\t\" merely to gain time\"\n",
      "null\t\" But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General  Bonaparte, there is a difference, remarked Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Thats just it, interrupted Dolgorkov quickly, laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know Bilbinhes a very clever fellow\"\n",
      "null\t\" He suggested  addressing him as Usurper and Enemy of Mankind\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dolgorkov laughed merrily\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Only that? said Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the same, it was Bilbin who found a suitable form for the  address\"\n",
      "null\t\" What was it?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Au chef du gouvernement  franais, said Dolgorkov, with grave satisfaction\"\n",
      "null\t\" Good, wasnt it?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, hes dined with himthe present Emperormore than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know, a combination of French adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and Count Markv? Count Markv was the only man who knew how to handle  him\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Delightful! said Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" But I have come to you, Prince,  as a petitioner on behalf of this young man\"\n",
      "null\t\" but before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon  Dolgorkov to the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, what a nuisance, said Dolgorkov, getting up hurriedly and  pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know I should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young  man\"\n",
      "null\t\" Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of  good-natured, sincere, and animated levity\"\n",
      "null\t\" another time!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny,  obedient, and insignificant atom\"\n",
      "null\t\" They followed Prince Dolgorkov out into the corridor and metcoming out of the door of the Emperors room by which Dolgorkov had entereda short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling  his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" This short man nodded to Dolgorkov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and  evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other  turned away and went down the side of the corridor\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Who was that? asked Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of  menthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartorski\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is such men as he who decide the fate of nations, added Bolknski  with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of Austerlitz, Bors was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorkov  again and remained for a while with the Ismylov regiment\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER X\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals  Bagratin and Dolgorkov ride past with their adjutants\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the fear before action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself  as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostv spent that day in a dull and  wretched mood\"\n",
      "null\t\" At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French  cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a stnya of Cossacks\"\n",
      "null\t\" Evidently the  affair was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement\"\n",
      "null\t\" The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French  squadron\"\n",
      "null\t\" The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rostv going or  coming\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all  the more depressed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Come here, Wostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lets dwink to dwown our gwief! shouted Densov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some  food\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The officers gathered round Densovs canteen, eating and talking\"\n",
      "null\t\" There! They are bringing another! cried one of the officers, indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by  two Cossacks\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had  taken from the prisoner\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Sell us that horse! Densov called out to the Cossacks\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you like, your honor!\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German  accent\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,  addressing first one, then another\"\n",
      "null\t\" He said he would not have been taken, it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to  seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there\"\n",
      "null\t\" And at every word he added: But dont hurt my little horse! and  stroked the animal\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he  was\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly  discipline and zeal in the service\"\n",
      "null\t\" He brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was  so alien to us\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostv, being the  richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it\"\n",
      "null\t\" But dont hurt my little horse! said the Alsatian good-naturedly  to Rostv when the animal was handed over to the hussar\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money\"\n",
      "null\t\" Alley! Alley! said the Cossack, touching the prisoners arm to  make him go on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Emperor! The Emperor! was suddenly heard among the hussars\"\n",
      "null\t\" All began to run and bustle, and Rostv saw coming up the road behind  him several riders with white plumes in their hats\"\n",
      "null\t\" In a moment everyone  was in his place, waiting\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of  himself had vanished\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was filled with happiness at his nearness to  the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the  day he had lost\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of  meeting arrives\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not daring to look round and without looking round, he  was ecstatically conscious of his approach\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more  festive around him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nearer and nearer to Rostv came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with Rostvs feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard  the Emperors voice\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Pvlograd hussars? he inquired\"\n",
      "null\t\" The reserves, sire! replied a voice, a very human one compared to that which had said: The Pvlograd hussars?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Alexanders face was  even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review\"\n",
      "null\t\" It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face  of the majestic Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Casually, while surveying the squadron, the Emperors eyes met Rostvs and rested on them for not more than  two seconds\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rostvs soul (it seemed to Rostv that he understood everything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into  Rostvs face\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left  foot, and galloped on\"\n",
      "null\t\" The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve oclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped  toward the vanguard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before he came up with the hussars, several  adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action\"\n",
      "null\t\" This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were  retreating against their will\"\n",
      "null\t\" A few minutes after the Emperor had  passed, the Pvlograd division was ordered to advance\"\n",
      "null\t\" In Wischau  itself, a petty German town, Rostv saw the Emperor again\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperors arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there  had not been time to move\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor, surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked  at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head\"\n",
      "null\t\" The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity  to the Emperor shocked Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv saw how the Emperors rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horses side with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not  stir\"\n",
      "null\t\" An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to  place him on a stretcher that had been brought\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldier groaned\"\n",
      "null\t\" The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight of the enemys lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us  at the least firing\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperors gratitude was announced to the vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of  vodka\"\n",
      "null\t\" The campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded  even more merrily than on the previous night\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and Rostv, who had already drunk  enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperors health\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not our Sovereign, the Emperor, as they say at official dinners, said he, but the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French!\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the old cavalry captain, Krsten, shouted enthusiastically and no  less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Krsten filled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the soldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light  of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lads! heres to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our enemies! Hurrah! he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussars  baritone\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Late that night, when all had separated, Densov with his short hand  patted his favorite, Rostv, on the shoulder\"\n",
      "null\t\" As theres no one to fall in love with on campaign, hes fallen  in love with the Tsar, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Densov, dont make fun of it! cried Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is such a  lofty, beautiful feeling, such a\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, you dont understand!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian  arms and the hope of future triumph\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the  Russian arms\"\n",
      "null\t\" The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,  was repeatedly summoned to see him\"\n",
      "null\t\" At headquarters and among the troops  near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell\"\n",
      "null\t\" He ate nothing and  had slept badly that night, those around him reported\"\n",
      "null\t\" The cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by  the sight of the killed and wounded\"\n",
      "null\t\" At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was  brought into Wischau from our outposts\"\n",
      "null\t\" This officer was Savary\"\n",
      "null\t\" At midday he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with  Prince Dolgorkov to the advanced post of the French army\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander  a meeting with Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the joy and pride of the whole army, a personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince Dolgorkov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were  actuated by a real desire for peace\"\n",
      "null\t\" Toward evening Dolgorkov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and  remained alone with him for a long time\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two days march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange  of shots retreated\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz  was fought\"\n",
      "null\t\" Till midday on the nineteenth, the activitythe eager talk, running to and fro, and dispatching of adjutantswas confined to the Emperors  headquarters\"\n",
      "null\t\" But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached  Kutzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns\"\n",
      "null\t\" By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles  long\"\n",
      "null\t\" The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperors headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower  clock\"\n",
      "null\t\" One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with  regular motion as a result of all that activity\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet  reached\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins  in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human activities of 160,000 Russians and Frenchall their passions, desires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasmwas only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called battle of the three Emperorsthat is to say, a slow movement  of the hand on the dial of human history\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the  commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" At six in the evening, Kutzov went to the Emperors headquarters and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand  marshal of the court, Count Tolsty\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bolknski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the  coming action from Dolgorkov\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt that Kutzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperors headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do  not know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorkov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, how dyou do, my dear fellow? said Dolgorkov, who was  sitting at tea with Bilbin\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fete is for tomorrow\"\n",
      "null\t\" But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte  fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, you have seen him? said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement, repeated Dolgorkov, evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with  Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\" If he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid,  afraid of a general battle\"\n",
      "null\t\" His hour has come! Mark my words!\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him Your Majesty, but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! Thats the sort of man he is, and nothing more, replied  Dolgorkov, looking round at Bilbin with a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" Despite my great respect for old Kutzov, he continued, we should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands! No, we mustnt forget Suvrov and his rulenot to put  yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack\"\n",
      "null\t\" Believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all  the experience of old Cunctators\"\n",
      "null\t\" But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are  situated, said Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" He wished to explain to Dolgorkov a plan of attack he had himself  formed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, that is all the same, Dolgorkov said quickly, and getting up  he spread a map on the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" All eventualities have been foreseen\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Prince Dolgorkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrothers  plan of a flanking movement\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might have been as good as Weyrothers, but for the disadvantage that  Weyrothers had already been approved\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan, Prince Dolgorkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not  at the map, but at Prince Andrews face\"\n",
      "null\t\" There will be a council of war at Kutzovs tonight, though; you  can say all this there, remarked Dolgorkov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I will do so, said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen? said Bilbin, who, till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and  now was evidently ready with a joke\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether tomorrow brings  victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure\"\n",
      "null\t\" Except your Kutzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on  like all those Polish names\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Be quiet, backbiter! said Dolgorkov\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is not true; there are now two Russians, Milordovich, and Dokhtrov, and there would be  a third, Count Arakchev, if his nerves were not too weak\"\n",
      "null\t\" However, I think General Kutzov has come out, said Prince  Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\" I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen! he added and  went out after shaking hands with Dolgorkov and Bilbin\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutzov, who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrows  battle\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied: I think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolsty and  asked him to tell the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" What do you think he replied? But, my dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military  matters yourself! Yes\"\n",
      "null\t\" That was the answer I got!\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chiefs and with the exception of Prince Bagratin, who declined to  come, were all there at the appointed time\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kutzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and  president of the council of war\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother evidently felt himself to be  at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was  like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead  to\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys picket line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived  at Kutzovs\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the  commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly, without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to  questions put to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and  self-confident\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions near  Ostralitz\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the large drawing room which had become the commander in chiefs office were gathered Kutzov himself, Weyrother, and the  members of the council of war\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were drinking tea, and only awaited  Prince Bagratin to begin the council\"\n",
      "null\t\" At last Bagratins orderly  came with the news that the prince could not attend\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself of permission previously given him by Kutzov to be present at the  council, he remained in the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Since Prince Bagratin is not coming, we may begin, said Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on  which an enormous map of the environs of Brnn was spread out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair,  with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the sound  of Weyrothers voice, he opened his one eye with an effort\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late, said he, and nodding  his head he let it droop and again closed his eye\"\n",
      "null\t\" If at first the members of the council thought that Kutzov was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything elsehe was engaged in satisfying the  irresistible human need for sleep\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutzov and, having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The dispositions were very complicated and difficult\"\n",
      "null\t\" They began as follows:\"\n",
      "null\t\" For this  object it is necessary that\"\n",
      "null\t\" The second  column marches\"\n",
      "null\t\" and so on, read  Weyrother\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions\"\n",
      "null\t\" The tall, fair-haired General Buxhwden stood, leaning his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen  or even to wish to be thought to listen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Milordovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders  raised\"\n",
      "null\t\" He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrothers face, and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished  reading\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then Milordovich looked round significantly at the other  generals\"\n",
      "null\t\" But one could not tell from that significant look whether he  agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners  a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the middle of one of the longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his  thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say: You can tell me your views later, but now be so  good as to look at the map and listen\"\n",
      "null\t\" Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity, turned round to Milordovich as if seeking an explanation, but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless  gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox\"\n",
      "null\t\" A geography lesson! he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough  to be heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Przebyszwski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in  attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dohktrov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map  conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality\"\n",
      "null\t\" He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard  and the difficult names of villages\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother complied and Dohktrov  noted them down\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be known,  whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement\"\n",
      "null\t\" Langerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show General Weyrotherwho had read his dispositions with as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school childrenthat he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something  in military matters\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the monotonous sound of Weyrothers voice ceased, Kutzov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel  is interrupted\"\n",
      "null\t\" He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, So you are still at that silly business! quickly closed his eye  again, and let his head sink still lower\"\n",
      "null\t\" Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrothers vanity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this  plan perfectly worthless\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections  be they what they might\"\n",
      "null\t\"  If he could attack us, he would have done so today, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\"  So you think he is powerless? said Langeron\"\n",
      "null\t\" He has forty thousand men at most, replied Weyrother, with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of  a case\"\n",
      "null\t\" In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack, said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support  to Milordovich who was near him\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Milordovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything  rather than of what the generals were disputing about\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ma foi! said he, tomorrow we shall see all that on the  battlefield\"\n",
      "null\t\" Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but  had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of\"\n",
      "null\t\" The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from  his camp, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" What does that mean? Either he is retreating,  which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position\"\n",
      "null\t\" (He smiled ironically\"\n",
      "null\t\") But even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our  arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How is that?\"\n",
      "null\t\" began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting  an opportunity to express his doubts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the  generals\"\n",
      "null\t\" Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrowor rather for today, for  it is past midnightcannot now be altered, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" You have  heard them, and we shall all do our duty\"\n",
      "null\t\" But before a battle, there is  nothing more important\"\n",
      "null\t\" he paused, than to have a good sleep\"\n",
      "null\t\" The generals bowed and retired\"\n",
      "null\t\" The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy  impression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether Dolgorkov and Weyrother, or Kutzov, Langeron, and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were  righthe did not know\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow, he  thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days  when he first loved her\"\n",
      "null\t\" He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvtski and began  to walk up and down before it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed  mysteriously\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow! he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly, I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all  I can do\"\n",
      "null\t\" And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the  commanders\"\n",
      "null\t\" And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had  so long waited, presents itself to him at last\"\n",
      "null\t\" He firmly and clearly  expresses his opinion to Kutzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors\"\n",
      "null\t\" All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a divisionstipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangementsleads his division to  the decisive point, and gains the victory alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" But death and  suffering? suggested another voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, however, did not  answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs\"\n",
      "null\t\" The dispositions  for the next battle are planned by him alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nominally he is only an  adjutant on Kutzovs staff, but he does everything alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" The next  battle is won by him alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov is removed and he is appointed\"\n",
      "null\t\" If before that you are  not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well\"\n",
      "null\t\" what then?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and mens esteem? Death,  wounds, the loss of familyI fear nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" And precious and dear as many persons are to mefather, sister, wifethose dearest to meyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I dont know and never shall know, for the love of these men here, he  thought, as he listened to voices in Kutzovs courtyard\"\n",
      "null\t\" The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a coachmans, was teasing Kutzovs old cook whom Prince Andrew knew,  and who was called Tit\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was saying, Tit, I say, Tit!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Go, Tit, thresh a bit! said the wag\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, go to the devil! called out a voice, drowned by the laughter  of the orderlies and servants\"\n",
      "null\t\" That same night, Rostv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front  of Bagratins detachment\"\n",
      "null\t\" His hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the  sleepiness that kept coming over him\"\n",
      "null\t\" An enormous space, with our armys campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him;  in front of him was misty darkness\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy  ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appearednow the Emperor, now Densov, and now Moscow memoriesand he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty  darkness\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why not?\"\n",
      "null\t\" There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask his deceivers! And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign, Rostv pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom  he would slap in the face before the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly a distant shout  aroused him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He started and opened his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" pass and  watchwordshaft, Olmtz\"\n",
      "null\t\" What a nuisance that our squadron will be in  reserve tomorrow, he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill ask leave to go to the front,  this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" It wont be long  now before I am off duty\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill take another turn and when I get back  Ill go to the general and ask him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He readjusted himself in the  saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars\"\n",
      "null\t\" It  seemed to him that it was getting lighter\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a  wall\"\n",
      "null\t\" On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostv could not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on  that white spot\"\n",
      "null\t\" that spot\"\n",
      "null\t\" its not a tache\"\n",
      "null\t\" tasha\"\n",
      "null\t\" take my  sabretache\"\n",
      "null\t\"Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes here, came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostv was riding in  the act of falling asleep\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv lifted his head that had sunk almost  to his horses mane and pulled up beside the hussar\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was succumbing  to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" But what was I  thinking? I mustnt forget\"\n",
      "null\t\" How shall I speak to the Emperor? No,  thats not itthats tomorrow\"\n",
      "null\t\" sabretache\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whom? The hussars\"\n",
      "null\t\" I thought about  him too, just opposite Gryevs house\"\n",
      "null\t\" Old Gryev\"\n",
      "null\t\" The chief thing  is that the Emperor is here\"\n",
      "null\t\" How he looked at me and wished to say  something, but dared not\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, it was I who dared not\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, Na-tsha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! Thats  right! And his head once more sank to his horses neck\"\n",
      "null\t\" All at once  it seemed to him that he was being fired at\"\n",
      "null\t\" What? What? What?\"\n",
      "null\t\" said Rostv, waking up\"\n",
      "null\t\" His horse and the horse of the hussar  near him pricked their ears at these shouts\"\n",
      "null\t\" Over there, where the shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another, and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the  shouting grew louder and louder\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv could hear the sound of French  words but could not distinguish them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats that? What do you make of it? said Rostv to the hussar  beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\" That must be the enemys camp!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, dont you hear it? Rostv asked again, after waiting for a  reply\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Who can tell, your honor? replied the hussar reluctantly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  From the direction, it must be the enemy, repeated Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It may be he or it may be nothing, muttered the hussar\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its  dark\"\n",
      "null\t\" Steady! he cried to his fidgeting horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" The shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army  of several thousand men could produce\"\n",
      "null\t\" The lights spread farther and  farther, probably along the line of the French camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv no longer  wanted to sleep\"\n",
      "null\t\" The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a  stimulating effect on him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vive lEmpereur! lEmpereur! he now  heard distinctly\"\n",
      "null\t\" They cant be far off, probably just beyond the stream, he said  to the hussar beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sound of horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars  suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Your honor, the generals! said the sergeant, riding up to Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with  the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line\"\n",
      "null\t\" One was on a white horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Bagratin and Prince Dolgorkov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the  lights and shouts in the enemys camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv rode up to Bagratin, reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the  generals were saying\"\n",
      "null\t\" Believe me, said Prince Dolgorkov, addressing Bagratin, it is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to  kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hardly, said Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" I saw them this evening on that  knoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were there this evening, but now I dont know, your  excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" Shall I go with some of my hussars to see? replied  Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostvs face  in the mist\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, go and see, he said, after a pause\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, sir\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fdchenko and two other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction  from which the shouting came\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty  distance where no one had been before him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostv pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes  for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemys fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly  and distinctly\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the valley he saw before him something like a river,  but when he reached it he found it was a road\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or  cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside\"\n",
      "null\t\" To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it  would be easier to see people coming along it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Follow me! said he, crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the  point where the French pickets had been standing that evening\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Your honor, there he is! cried one of the hussars behind him\"\n",
      "null\t\" And before Rostv had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed  out of hearing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan\"\n",
      "null\t\" Four more reports followed at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in  different tones\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen,  like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, some  more! Some more! a merry voice was saying in his soul\"\n",
      "null\t\" But no more  shots came\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only when approaching Bagratin did Rostv let his horse gallop again,  and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dolgorkov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had  only lit fires to deceive us\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What does that prove? he was saying as Rostv rode up\"\n",
      "null\t\" They  might retreat and leave the pickets\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince, said  Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wait till tomorrow morning, well find out everything  tomorrow\"\n",
      "null\t\" The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was in the evening, reported Rostv, stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his  ride and especially by the sound of the bullets\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Very good, very good, said Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Your excellency, said Rostv, may I ask a favor?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats your name?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Count Ily Rostvs son? asked Dolgorkov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But Rostv did not reply\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the  Emperor, thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the fact that while Napoleons proclamation was being read to the troops the  Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers, on seeing him, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, Vive lEmpereur! Napoleons proclamation was as follows:\"\n",
      "null\t\" They are the same battalions you broke at  Hollabrnn and have pursued ever since to this place\"\n",
      "null\t\" The position we occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on  the right they will expose a flank to me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Soldiers! I will myself direct  your battalions\"\n",
      "null\t\" I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the  honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace  I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself\"\n",
      "null\t\" NAPOLEON\"\n",
      "null\t\" The troops of the center, the reserves, and Bagratins right flank had not yet moved, but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan,  were already up and astir\"\n",
      "null\t\" The smoke of the campfires, into which they  were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was cold  and dark\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they  did not want or could not carry away with them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds  of the advance\"\n",
      "null\t\" As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officers quarters, the regiment began to move: the soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their  bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank\"\n",
      "null\t\" The officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches,  and moved along the ranks shouting\"\n",
      "null\t\" The train drivers and orderlies  harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads\"\n",
      "null\t\" The adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet  resounded\"\n",
      "null\t\" The column moved forward without knowing where and unable, from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see  either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going\"\n",
      "null\t\" A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as  much as a sailor is by his ship\"\n",
      "null\t\" However far he has walked, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major Ivn Mtrich, the same company dog Jack, and the  same commanders\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing, but on the day of battleheaven knows how and whencea stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive  and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning  what is going on around them\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could  not see ten paces ahead\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level  ground like cliffs and slopes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anywhere, on any side, one might  encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the columns advanced for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills, avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and  nowhere encountering the enemy\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the contrary, the soldiers became aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns  were moving in the same direction\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going  too\"\n",
      "null\t\" There now, the Krskies have also gone past, was being said in  the ranks\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last  night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to  an attack\"\n",
      "null\t\" But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness  of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks\"\n",
      "null\t\" How such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,  and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek\"\n",
      "null\t\" Had the Russian army been alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been  occasioned by the sausage eaters\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up against the French?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyd be firing if we had\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, Id send them on in front, but no fear, theyre crowding up  behind\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the  way, said an officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, those damned Germans! They dont know their own country!  said another\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What division are you? shouted an adjutant, riding up\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Eighteenth\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you  wont get there till evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" What stupid orders! They dont themselves know what they are  doing! said the officer and rode off\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tafa-lafa! But what hes jabbering no one can make out, said a  soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away\"\n",
      "null\t\" We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we havent got  halfway\"\n",
      "null\t\" Fine orders! was being repeated on different sides\"\n",
      "null\t\" The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all  ordered to turn back to the right\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several thousand cavalry crossed in  front of the infantry, who had to wait\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a  Russian general\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to  blame\"\n",
      "null\t\" The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they  were descending\"\n",
      "null\t\" In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another,  at first irregularly at varying intervalstrata\"\n",
      "null\t\"tatand then more and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream  began\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown  surroundings unable to find their own regiments\"\n",
      "null\t\" In this way the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into  the valley\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fourth column, with which Kutzov was, stood on the  Pratzen Heights\"\n",
      "null\t\" Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was  going on in front\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed, six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one  knew till after eight oclock\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It was nine oclock in the morning\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon  stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light\"\n",
      "null\t\" Above him was a clear blue sky, and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollow,  crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist\"\n",
      "null\t\" The whole French army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could  distinguish a mounted man from one on foot\"\n",
      "null\t\" Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab  horse a little in front of his marshals\"\n",
      "null\t\" He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of  firing in the valley\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not a single muscle of his facewhich in those  days was still thinmoved\"\n",
      "null\t\" His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on  one spot\"\n",
      "null\t\" Part of the Russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack  and regarded as the key to the position\"\n",
      "null\t\" He saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into  the mist\"\n",
      "null\t\" From information he had received the evening before, from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night, by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already  sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked\"\n",
      "null\t\" But still he did not  begin the engagement\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Today was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coronation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything  succeeds\"\n",
      "null\t\" He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident, self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily  in love\"\n",
      "null\t\" The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his  attention\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating  up out of the mist\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to begin the actionhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign  with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin\"\n",
      "null\t\" The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by  Russian troops moving down the valley to their left\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER XV\"\n",
      "null\t\" He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead  that column himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he had reached the village of Pratzen he  halted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the  commander in chiefs suite\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of  a long-awaited moment\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was firmly convinced that this was the day of  his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola\"\n",
      "null\t\" How it would come about he did not  know, but he felt sure it would do so\"\n",
      "null\t\" The locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone  in our army\"\n",
      "null\t\" His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now  be carried out, was forgotten\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now, entering into Weyrothers plan, Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects  such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces  could be heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would  concentrate\"\n",
      "null\t\" There we shall encounter difficulties, and there, thought he, I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of  me\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions\"\n",
      "null\t\" Seeing them he kept thinking, That may be the very standard with  which I shall lead the army\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a  milk-white sea\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which  our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb  of the sun\"\n",
      "null\t\" In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist, some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably  was, for something could be descried\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the right the Guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses  of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist\"\n",
      "null\t\" In front and  behind moved infantry\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commander in chief was standing at the end of  the village letting the troops pass by him\"\n",
      "null\t\" That morning Kutzov seemed  worn and irritable\"\n",
      "null\t\" The infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in  front\"\n",
      "null\t\" Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the  village! he said angrily to a general who had ridden up\"\n",
      "null\t\" I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,  answered the general\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kutzov laughed bitterly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very fine!\"\n",
      "null\t\" According to the  dispositions\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The dispositions! exclaimed Kutzov bitterly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who told you  that?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kindly do as you are ordered\"\n",
      "null\t\" My dear fellow, Nesvtski whispered to Prince Andrew, the old  man is as surly as a dog\"\n",
      "null\t\" An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to Kutzov and asked in the Emperors name had the fourth  column advanced into action\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall  upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Seeing him, Kutzovs malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being done was not his adjutants fault, and still not answering  the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolknski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the  village\"\n",
      "null\t\" Tell it to stop and await my orders\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted, he added\"\n",
      "null\t\" What are they doing? What are they doing? he murmured to himself, still  not replying to the Austrian\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order\"\n",
      "null\t\" Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no  sharpshooters in front of our columns\"\n",
      "null\t\" The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefs order to throw  out skirmishers\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops  in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent  hidden by dense mist\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having given orders in the commander in chiefs  name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle  with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" The troops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets  on the ground\"\n",
      "null\t\" All right, all right! he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all  the left-flank columns had already descended\"\n",
      "null\t\" Plenty of time, your excellency, muttered Kutzov in the midst of  a yawn\"\n",
      "null\t\" Plenty of time, he repeated\"\n",
      "null\t\" Evidently the person they were  greeting was riding quickly\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kutzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one  side and looked round with a frown\"\n",
      "null\t\" Along the road from Pratzen galloped  what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two of them  rode side by side in front, at full gallop\"\n",
      "null\t\" One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who  was in a white uniform rode a black one\"\n",
      "null\t\" These were the two Emperors  followed by their suites\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, gave the command Attention! and rode up  to the Emperors with a salute\"\n",
      "null\t\" His whole appearance and manner were  suddenly transformed\"\n",
      "null\t\" He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys  without reasoning\"\n",
      "null\t\" With an affectation of respect which evidently struck  Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted\"\n",
      "null\t\" This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face  of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished\"\n",
      "null\t\" After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmtz where Bolknski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted  innocent youth\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the Olmtz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed  brighter and more energetic\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round  at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own\"\n",
      "null\t\" Czartorski, Novosltsev, Prince Volknsky, Strgonov, and the others, all richly dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the  Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and  preoccupied manner\"\n",
      "null\t\" He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some questionMost likely he is asking at what oclock they started, thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with  a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brnn\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the Emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the  Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian\"\n",
      "null\t\" Among them were grooms leading the Tsars beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered  cloths\"\n",
      "null\t\" As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of success reached Kutzovs cheerless staff with the galloping advent  of all these brilliant young men\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why arent you beginning, Michael Ilarinovich? said the Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kutzov, glancing courteously at the  same time at the Emperor Francis\"\n",
      "null\t\" I am waiting, Your Majesty, answered Kutzov, bending forward  respectfully\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not  quite heard\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Waiting, Your Majesty, repeated Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" (Prince Andrew noted that Kutzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the  word waiting\"\n",
      "null\t\") Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your  Majesty\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosltsev who was near him, as  if complaining of Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, Michael Ilarinovich, we are not on the Empress Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled, said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting  him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the  Emperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen\"\n",
      "null\t\" That is just why I do not begin, sire, said Kutzov in a resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and again something in his face twitchedThat is just why I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the  Empress Field, said he clearly and distinctly\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the Emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed  dissatisfaction and reproach\"\n",
      "null\t\" Old though he may be, he should not, he  certainly should not, speak like that, their glances seemed to say\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutzovs eye  waiting to hear whether he would say anything more\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Kutzov, with  respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting\"\n",
      "null\t\" The silence lasted  for about a minute\"\n",
      "null\t\" However, if you command it, Your Majesty, said Kutzov, lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but  submissive general\"\n",
      "null\t\" He touched his horse and having called Milordovich, the commander of  the column, gave him the order to advance\"\n",
      "null\t\" The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Nvgorod and  one of the psheron regiment went forward past the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" As this psheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milordovich, without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined  in his horse before the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\"  God be with you, general! said the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilit, sire, * he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among  the gentlemen of the Tsars suite by his poor French\"\n",
      "null\t\" * Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to  do, Sire\"\n",
      "null\t\" Milordovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little  behind the Emperor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The psheron men, excited by the Tsars presence, passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk  pace\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lads! shouted Milordovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of battle, and by the sight of the gallant psherons, his comrades in Suvrovs time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he  forgot the sovereigns presence\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lads, its not the first village  youve had to take, cried he\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Glad to do our best! shouted the soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Emperors horse started at the sudden cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" This horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis black cob, nor of all that was  being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a  remark to him, pointing to the gallant psherons\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the  carabineers\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an  inn, where two roads parted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both of them led downhill and troops were  marching along both\"\n",
      "null\t\" The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible  about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights\"\n",
      "null\t\" Down below, on  the left, the firing became more distinct\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov had stopped and was  speaking to an Austrian general\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew, who was a little behind  looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass\"\n",
      "null\t\" Look, look! said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the  distance, but down the hill before him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying  to snatch it from one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" The expression on all their faces  suddenly changed to one of horror\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French were supposed to be a mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in  front of us\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its the enemy?\"\n",
      "null\t\" for certain\"\n",
      "null\t\" With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more than five hundred paces from where Kutzov was standing, a dense French  column coming up to meet the psherons\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived\"\n",
      "null\t\" My turn has come,  thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The psherons must be stopped, your excellency, cried he\"\n",
      "null\t\" But at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite close at hand, and a voice of nave terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew shouted, Brothers! Alls lost! And at this as if  at a command, everyone began to run\"\n",
      "null\t\" Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five  minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to  be carried back with it oneself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bolknski only tried not to lose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was  happening in front of him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nesvtski with an angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutzov that if he did not ride away at once  he would certainly be taken prisoner\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov remained in the same  place and without answering drew out a handkerchief\"\n",
      "null\t\" Blood was flowing  from his cheek\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are wounded? he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of  his lower jaw\"\n",
      "null\t\" The wound is not here, it is there! said Kutzov, pressing the  handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Stop them! he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the  right\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it\"\n",
      "null\t\" The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by  them it was difficult to get out again\"\n",
      "null\t\" One was shouting, Get on! Why are you hindering us? Another in the same place turned round and  fired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutzov himself rode\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kutzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a  sound of artillery fire near by\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutzov, saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing  and Frenchmen running toward it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Higher up stood some Russian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the  fleeing crowd\"\n",
      "null\t\" A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and  approached Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were  all pale and exchanged looks in silence\"\n",
      "null\t\" Stop those wretches! gasped Kutzov to the regimental commander, pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across  Kutzovs suite like a flock of little birds\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutzov, were firing  at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the  flag let it fall from his hands\"\n",
      "null\t\" It swayed and fell, but caught on the  muskets of the nearest soldiers\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers started firing without  orders\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh! Oh! Oh! groaned Kutzov despairingly and looked around\"\n",
      "null\t\" But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to  the standard\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Forward, lads! he shouted in a voice piercing as a childs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here it is! thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and  hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several soldiers fell\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hurrah! shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole  battalion would follow him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And really he only ran a few steps alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting Hurrah!  and overtook him\"\n",
      "null\t\" A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrews hands, but he  was immediately killed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,  dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion\"\n",
      "null\t\" In front he saw our artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned  their guns, were running toward him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns  round\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces  of the cannon\"\n",
      "null\t\" He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and  to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped\"\n",
      "null\t\" But he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front  of himat the battery\"\n",
      "null\t\" He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while  a French soldier tugged at the other\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who  evidently did not realize what they were doing\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What are they about? thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why doesnt the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why doesnt the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the  Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him\"\n",
      "null\t\" And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,  was about to be decided\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head  with the full swing of a bludgeon\"\n",
      "null\t\" It hurt a little, but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had  been looking at\"\n",
      "null\t\" Whats this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way, thought he,  and fell on his back\"\n",
      "null\t\" He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or  saved\"\n",
      "null\t\" But he saw nothing\"\n",
      "null\t\" How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as I ran, thought Prince Andrewnot as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All  is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky\"\n",
      "null\t\" There is nothing,  nothing, but that\"\n",
      "null\t\" But even it does not exist, there is nothing but  quiet and peace\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thank God!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not wishing to agree to Dolgorkovs demand to commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagratin proposed to Dolgorkov to send to inquire of the  commander in chief\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed (which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief (which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before  evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite, and the boyish face of Rostv, breathless with excitement and hope, was  the first to catch his eye\"\n",
      "null\t\" He sent him\"\n",
      "null\t\" You can give the message to His Majesty, said Dolgorkov,  hurriedly interrupting Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" On being relieved from picket duty Rostv had managed to get a few hours sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and  easy\"\n",
      "null\t\" All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a  message to Kutzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" The morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of  joy and happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein  and galloped along the line\"\n",
      "null\t\" At first he rode along the line of Bagratins troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uvrovs cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle; having passed Uvrovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon  and musketry ahead of him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The firing grew louder and louder\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading,  and mingling with one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could also, by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow  lines of artillery with green caissons\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops;  but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out\"\n",
      "null\t\" These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him;  on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go on! Go on! Give it them! he mentally exclaimed at these sounds, and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and  farther into the region where the army was already in action\"\n",
      "null\t\" How it will be there I dont know, but all will be well! thought  Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the  line (the Guards) was already in action\"\n",
      "null\t\"  So much the better! I shall see it close, he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He was riding almost along the front line\"\n",
      "null\t\" A handful of men came  galloping toward him\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were our Uhlans who with disordered  ranks were returning from the attack\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv got out of their way,  involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on\"\n",
      "null\t\"  That is no business of mine, he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and  across his path\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the  horses were already galloping\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and  even their faces, more and more distinctly\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were our Horse Guards,  advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv could already see their faces and heard the command: Charge! shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to  full speed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but  still was not in time to avoid them\"\n",
      "null\t\" The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily  on seeing Rostv before him, with whom he would inevitably collide\"\n",
      "null\t\" This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostv and his Bedouin over (Rostv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rostv to flourish his whip before  the eyes of the Guardsmans horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail  and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostv before he heard them shout, Hurrah! and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some  foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could see nothing more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and  smoke enveloped everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in the smoke, Rostv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where  he was sent\"\n",
      "null\t\" This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that  amazed the French themselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their  thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see  the Emperor immediately! thought Rostv and galloped on\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the  officers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a  voice calling him by name\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv!\"\n",
      "null\t\" I say, weve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked! said Bors with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been  under fire for the first time\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv stopped\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Have you? he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, how did it go?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Can you imagine it? and he began describing how the Guards, having taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had  unexpectedly to go into action\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv without hearing Bors to the  end spurred his horse\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Where are you off to? asked Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\"  With a message to His Majesty\"\n",
      "null\t\" There he is! said Bors, thinking Rostv had said His Highness, and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse Guards jacket, shouting something to a pale, white  uniformed Austrian officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" But thats the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the  Emperor, said Rostv, and was about to spur his horse\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count! Count! shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager  as Bors\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count! I am wounded in my right hand (and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) and I remained at  the front\"\n",
      "null\t\" I held my sword in my left hand, Count\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostv, to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place  where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops,  where he could never have expected the enemy to be\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What can it be? he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" The enemy in the rear of our army? Impossible! And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself  and for the issue of the whole battle\"\n",
      "null\t\" But be that what it may,  he reflected, there is no riding round it now\"\n",
      "null\t\" I must look for the commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with  the rest\"\n",
      "null\t\" The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostv was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of  Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds\"\n",
      "null\t\" What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is firing? Rostv kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian  soldiers running in confused crowds across his path\"\n",
      "null\t\" The devil knows! Theyve killed everybody! Its all up now! he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who  understood what was happening as little as he did\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Kill the Germans! shouted one\"\n",
      "null\t\" May the devil take themthe traitors!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams,  and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing  at one another\"\n",
      "null\t\"  My God! What does it all mean? thought he\"\n",
      "null\t\" And here, where at  any moment the Emperor may see them\"\n",
      "null\t\" But no, these must be only a  handful of scoundrels\"\n",
      "null\t\" It will soon be over, it cant be that, it cant be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not,  did not wish to, believe that\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv had been ordered to look for Kutzov and the Emperor near the  village of Pratzen\"\n",
      "null\t\" But neither they nor a single commanding officer  were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds\"\n",
      "null\t\" He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but  the farther he went the more disorganized they were\"\n",
      "null\t\" The highroad on which he had come out was thronged with calches, carriages of all sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and  some not\"\n",
      "null\t\" This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries  stationed on the Pratzen Heights\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutzov? Rostv kept asking  everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\"  At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Eh, brother! Theyve all bolted long ago! said the soldier,  laughing for some reason and shaking himself free\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostv stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to  question him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and  that he was dangerously wounded\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It cant be! said Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" It must have been someone else\"\n",
      "null\t\" I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times Ive  seen him in Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\" There he sat in  the carriage as pale as anything\"\n",
      "null\t\" How they made the four black horses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! Its time I knew the Imperial  horses and Ily Ivnych\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded officer passing by addressed him:\"\n",
      "null\t\" The commander in chief? He was  killed by a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our regiment\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Not killedwounded! another officer corrected him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Who? Kutzov? asked Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Not Kutzov, but whats his namewell, never mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" there are  not many left alive\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go that way, to that village, all the commanders are there, said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek,  and he walked on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now  going\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which  he saw turrets and a church\"\n",
      "null\t\" What need to hurry? What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kutzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theyd kill you there!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where is he to  go? That way is nearer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv considered, and then went in the direction where they said he  would be killed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Its all the same now\"\n",
      "null\t\" If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to  save myself? he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" He rode on to the region where the greatest  number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French had not yet occupied that region, and the Russiansthe uninjured and slightly  woundedhad left it long ago\"\n",
      "null\t\" All about the field, like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded  to each couple of acres\"\n",
      "null\t\" The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes  feignedor so it seemed to Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraidafraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not  stand the sight of these unfortunates\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant  riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots\"\n",
      "null\t\" The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in Rostvs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity  for himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" What would she feel, thought he, if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?\"\n",
      "null\t\" The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire  sounded far away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle  was lost\"\n",
      "null\t\" No one whom Rostv asked could tell him where the Emperor  or Kutzov was\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperors carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolsty, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in  the Emperors suite\"\n",
      "null\t\" One officer told Rostv that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rostv  rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men  on horseback facing the ditch\"\n",
      "null\t\" One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rostv; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rostv fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his  horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only  a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horses hind hoofs\"\n",
      "null\t\" Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting  that he should do the same\"\n",
      "null\t\" The rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostv and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rostv instantly  recognized his lamented and adored monarch\"\n",
      "null\t\" But it cant be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!  thought Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostv  saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm,  the mildness of his features, was all the greater\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were  false\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was happy to be seeing him\"\n",
      "null\t\" But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with her, so Rostv, now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be  inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so\"\n",
      "null\t\" What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him? Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor  that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall\"\n",
      "null\t\" Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic  deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lost? No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his  reflections\"\n",
      "null\t\" Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him, Rostv decided; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the  Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision\"\n",
      "null\t\" While Rostv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away, Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him  to cross the ditch on foot\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling  unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,  covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Tolls hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I might have been in his place! thought Rostv, and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter  despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding\"\n",
      "null\t\" His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was  the cause of his grief\"\n",
      "null\t\"  He might\"\n",
      "null\t\" not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign\"\n",
      "null\t\" What have I done? thought he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only some carts and carriages  were passing by\"\n",
      "null\t\" From one of the drivers he learned that Kutzovs  staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv followed them\"\n",
      "null\t\" In front of him walked Kutzovs groom leading  horses in horsecloths\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old,  bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Tit! I say, Tit! said the groom\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What? answered the old man absent-mindedly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some time passed  in silence, and then the same joke was repeated\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points\"\n",
      "null\t\" More  than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Przebyszwski and his corps had laid down their arms\"\n",
      "null\t\" Other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused  masses\"\n",
      "null\t\" The remains of Langerons and Dokhtrovs mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of  Augesd\"\n",
      "null\t\" After five oclock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our  retreating forces\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the rearguard, Dokhtrov and others rallying some battalions kept up  a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops\"\n",
      "null\t\" It  was growing dusk\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their cartson that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to  move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and  splashing with blood those near them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhovnow an officerwounded in the arm, and on foot, with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,  represented all that was left of that whole regiment\"\n",
      "null\t\" Impelled by the crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a  cannon and the crowd were dragging it out\"\n",
      "null\t\" A cannon ball killed someone  behind them, another fell in front and splashed Dlokhov with blood\"\n",
      "null\t\" The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few  steps, and again stopped\"\n",
      "null\t\" Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here  another two minutes and it is certain death, thought each one\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the  slippery ice that covered the millpool\"\n",
      "null\t\" Turn this way! he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked  under him; turn this way! he shouted to those with the gun\"\n",
      "null\t\" It  bears!\"\n",
      "null\t\" The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even  under his weight alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" The men looked at him and pressed to the  bank, hesitating to step onto the ice\"\n",
      "null\t\" The general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address  Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that  everyone ducked\"\n",
      "null\t\" It flopped into something moist, and the general fell  from his horse in a pool of blood\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nobody gave him a look or thought of  raising him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Dont you hear? Go on! innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were  shouting\"\n",
      "null\t\" One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the  ice\"\n",
      "null\t\" The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped  into the water\"\n",
      "null\t\" The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from behind still came the shouts: Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go  on! Go on! And cries of horror were heard in the crowd\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and  move on\"\n",
      "null\t\" The ice, that had held under those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on  it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another\"\n",
      "null\t\" Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered  the dam, the pond, and the bank\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolknski bleeding profusely and unconsciously  uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not know  how long his unconsciousness lasted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly he again felt that he was  alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw  today? was his first thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" And I did not know this suffering  either, he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all  till now\"\n",
      "null\t\" He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices  speaking French\"\n",
      "null\t\" He opened his eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up  and stopped near him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left  on the field\"\n",
      "null\t\" Fine men! remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his  stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide\"\n",
      "null\t\" The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty, said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were  firing at Augesd\"\n",
      "null\t\" Have some brought from the reserve, said Napoleon, and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with  the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him\"\n",
      "null\t\" (The flag had already  been taken by the French as a trophy\"\n",
      "null\t\")\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was  Napoleon who said it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He heard the speaker addressed as Sire\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not only did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once  forgot them\"\n",
      "null\t\" His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,  and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky\"\n",
      "null\t\" He knew it was Napoleonhis herobut at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to  understand it so differently\"\n",
      "null\t\" He collected all his strength, to stir and  utter a sound\"\n",
      "null\t\" He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan  which aroused his own pity\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah! He is alive, said Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\" Lift this young man up and  carry him to the dressing station\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in  hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while  being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other  wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital\"\n",
      "null\t\" During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look  about him and even speak\"\n",
      "null\t\" The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French convoy officer, who said rapidly: We must halt here: the Emperor will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen  prisoners\"\n",
      "null\t\" There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army,  that he is probably tired of them, said another officer\"\n",
      "null\t\" All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor Alexanders Guards, said the first one, indicating a Russian  officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bolknski recognized Prince Repnn whom he had met in Petersburg  society\"\n",
      "null\t\" Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of  the Horse Guards\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Which is the senior? he asked, on seeing the prisoners\"\n",
      "null\t\"  They named the colonel, Prince Repnn\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are the commander of the Emperor Alexanders regiment of Horse  Guards? asked Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I commanded a squadron, replied Repnn\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably, said Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\" The praise of a great commander is a soldiers highest reward,  said Repnn\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I bestow it with pleasure, said Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\" And who is that young man beside you?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  After looking at him Napoleon smiled\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hes very young to come to meddle with us\"\n",
      "null\t\" Youth is no hindrance to courage, muttered Sukhtlen in a failing  voice\"\n",
      "null\t\"  A splendid reply! said Napoleon\"\n",
      "null\t\" Young man, you will go far!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet young man that was  connected in his memory with Prince Andrew\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, and you, young man, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed  straight on Napoleon, he was silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and  understood, that he could not answer him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,  suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Looking into Napoleons eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one  alive could understand or explain\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went: Have these gentlemen attended to and taken  to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds\"\n",
      "null\t\" Au revoir,  Prince Repnn! and he spurred his horse and galloped away\"\n",
      "null\t\"  His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure\"\n",
      "null\t\" The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brothers neck, but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to  return the holy image\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest  outside his uniform\"\n",
      "null\t\" It would be good, thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, it would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to  Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I  should be if I could now say: Lord, have mercy on me!\"\n",
      "null\t\" But to whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in wordsthe Great All or Nothing- said he to himself, or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but  all-important\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The stretchers moved on\"\n",
      "null\t\" At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;  his feverishness increased and he grew delirious\"\n",
      "null\t\" Visions of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious  fancies\"\n",
      "null\t\" The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented  itself to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was already enjoying that happiness when that little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments  had followed, and only the heavens promised peace\"\n",
      "null\t\" Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleons doctor,  Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence\"\n",
      "null\t\" He is a nervous, bilious subject, said Larrey, and will not  recover\"\n",
      "null\t\" And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of  the inhabitants of the district\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER I\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov was going home to Vornezh and Rostv persuaded him to travel with him  as far as Moscow and to stay with him there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before Moscow, Densov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostv, who grew more and more  impatient the nearer they got to Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets, shops, bakers signboards, street lamps, and sleighs! thought Rostv, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and  they had entered Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov! Were here! Hes asleep, he added, leaning forward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed  of the sleigh\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Densov gave no answer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Theres the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakhr, has his stand, and theres Zakhr himself and still the same horse! And heres the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Cant you hurry up? Now then!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why, that one, right at the end, the big one\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont you see?  Thats our house, said Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of course, its our house! Densov, Densov! Were almost there!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dmtri, said Rostv to his valet on the box, those lights are in our house, arent they?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then theyve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now, dont forget to put out my new coat, added Rostv, fingering his  new mustache\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now then, get on, he shouted to the driver\"\n",
      "null\t\" Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for vodkaget on! Rostv shouted, when the sleigh was only three  houses from his door\"\n",
      "null\t\" It seemed to him the horses were not moving at  all\"\n",
      "null\t\" At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and Rostv saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster  broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall\"\n",
      "null\t\" The house  stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was no one in the hall\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh God! Is everyone all right? he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of  the familiar staircase\"\n",
      "null\t\" The well-known old door handle, which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely  as ever\"\n",
      "null\t\" A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" Prokfy, the footman, who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat  plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one  of delighted amazement\"\n",
      "null\t\" Gracious heavens! The young count! he cried, recognizing his  young master\"\n",
      "null\t\" Can it be? My treasure! and Prokfy, trembling with excitement, rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the  young mans shoulder\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All well? asked Rostv, drawing away his arm\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, God be thanked! Yes! Theyve just finished supper\"\n",
      "null\t\" Let me have  a look at you, your excellency\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Lord be thanked, yes!\"\n",
      "null\t\" All was the same: there were the same old card tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began  hugging and kissing him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Another and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,  more outcries, and tears of joy\"\n",
      "null\t\" He could not distinguish which was  Papa, which Natsha, and which Ptya\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone shouted, talked, and  kissed him at the same time\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only his mother was not there, he noticed  that\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And I did not know\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas\"\n",
      "null\t\" our own\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where are the candles?\"\n",
      "null\t\" And me, kiss me!\"\n",
      "null\t\" and me!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ptya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, And me too!\"\n",
      "null\t\" All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around  were lips seeking a kiss\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss, looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she  longed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at  this moment of happy, rapturous excitement\"\n",
      "null\t\" She gazed at him, not taking  her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath\"\n",
      "null\t\" He gave her a  grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old  countess had not yet come\"\n",
      "null\t\" But now steps were heard at the door, steps  so rapid that they could hardly be his mothers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since  he had left\"\n",
      "null\t\" When they  met, she fell on his breast, sobbing\"\n",
      "null\t\" She could not lift her face, but  only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussars jacket\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov, who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped  his eyes at the sight\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vasli Densov, your sons friend, he said, introducing  himself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" You are most welcome! I know, I know, said the count, kissing and  embracing Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas wrote us\"\n",
      "null\t\" Darling Densov! screamed Natsha, beside herself with rapture,  springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him\"\n",
      "null\t\" This  escapade made everybody feel confused\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov blushed too, but smiled  and, taking Natshas hand, kissed it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostvs all  gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring  eyes off him\"\n",
      "null\t\" His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea,  handkerchief, and pipe\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed  insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept  till ten oclock\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the room next to their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,  satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two freshly  cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall\"\n",
      "null\t\" The servants were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their  well-brushed clothes\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco\"\n",
      "null\t\" Wostv, get up!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why, is it late?\"\n",
      "null\t\" A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of  girls voices came from the adjoining room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair,  and merry faces\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was Natsha, Snya, and Ptya, who had come to  see whether they were getting up\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Nicholas! Get up! Natshas voice was again heard at the door\"\n",
      "null\t\" Meanwhile, Ptya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room, with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,  opened the bedroom door\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Is this your saber? he shouted\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The girls sprang aside\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,  looking with a scared face at his comrade for help\"\n",
      "null\t\" The door, having let  Ptya in, closed again\"\n",
      "null\t\" A sound of laughter came from behind it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Is this your saber? asked Ptya\"\n",
      "null\t\" Or is it yours? he said,  addressing the black-mustached Densov with servile deference\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown,  and went out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting  her foot into the other\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya, when he came in, was twirling round and  was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down\"\n",
      "null\t\" They were dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and  bright\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya ran away, but Natsha, taking her brothers arm, led  him into the sitting room, where they began talking\"\n",
      "null\t\" They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand  little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves\"\n",
      "null\t\" Natsha laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable  to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, how nice, how splendid! she said to everything\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his  soul and his face\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, but listen, she said, now you are quite a man, arent  you? Im awfully glad youre my brother\"\n",
      "null\t\" She touched his  mustache\"\n",
      "null\t\" I want to know what you men are like\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, yes! Thats a whole long story! How are you going to speak to herthou or you?\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, call her you, please! Ill tell you all about it some other  time\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know Snyas my dearest friend\"\n",
      "null\t\" She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long, slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered  even by a ball dress\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I burned this to prove my love for her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natshas wildly bright eyes, Rostv re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life; and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem  to him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well, and is that all? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just  nonsense, but we are friends forever\"\n",
      "null\t\" She, if she loves anyone, does it  for life, but I dont understand that, I forget quickly\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, what then?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Natsha suddenly flushed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why, you remember before you went away?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, she says you are to  forget all that\"\n",
      "null\t\" She says: I shall love him always, but let him be  free\"\n",
      "null\t\" Isnt that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isnt it? asked Natsha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what  she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv became thoughtful\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I never go back on my word, he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides, Snya is so  charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, no! cried Natsha, she and I have already talked it over\"\n",
      "null\t\" We knew youd say so\"\n",
      "null\t\" But it wont do, because you see, if you say thatif you consider yourself bound by your promiseit will seem as  if she had not meant it seriously\"\n",
      "null\t\" It makes it as if you were marrying  her because you must, and that wouldnt do at all\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv saw that it had been well considered by them\"\n",
      "null\t\" Snya had already  struck him by her beauty on the preceding day\"\n",
      "null\t\" Today, when he had caught  a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was a charming girl of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt  that for an instant)\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why should he not love her now, and even marry her, Rostv thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him! Yes, they have taken a wise decision, he  thought, I must remain free\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well then, thats excellent, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well talk it over  later on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, how glad I am to have you!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh, what nonsense! cried Natsha, laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont think  about him or anyone else, and I dont want anything of the kind\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dear me! Then what are you up to now?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Have you seen Duport?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not seen Duportthe famous dancer? Well then, you wont  understand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats what Im up to\"\n",
      "null\t\" See, Im standing! See! she said, but could not maintain herself  on her toes any longer\"\n",
      "null\t\" So thats what Im up to! Ill never  marry anyone, but will be a dancer\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv laughed so loud and merrily that Densov, in his bedroom, felt  envious and Natsha could not help joining in\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, but dont you think its nice? she kept repeating\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Bors?\"\n",
      "null\t\" I dont want to marry anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But thats all rubbish, Natsha chattered on\"\n",
      "null\t\" And is  Densov nice? she asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, indeed!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is he very terrible, Densov?\"\n",
      "null\t\" No, Vska is a splendid  fellow\"\n",
      "null\t\" You call him Vska? Thats funny! And is he very nice?\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well then, be quick\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well all have breakfast together\"\n",
      "null\t\" When  Rostv met Snya in the drawing room, he reddened\"\n",
      "null\t\" He did not know  how to behave with her\"\n",
      "null\t\" The evening before, in the first happy moment of meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave  with her\"\n",
      "null\t\" He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as  youSnya\"\n",
      "null\t\" But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender  kisses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by Natshas intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then  thanked him for his love\"\n",
      "null\t\" His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to  love her, for that would be impossible\"\n",
      "null\t\" How strange it is, said Vra, selecting a moment when all were silent, that Snya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet  like strangers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Vras remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only Snya, Nicholas, and Natsha, but even the old countess, whodreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making  a brilliant matchblushed like a girl\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov, to Rostvs surprise, appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the  ladies and gentlemen than Rostv had ever expected to see him\"\n",
      "null\t\" On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostv was welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling Niklenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good  dancer, and one of the best matches in the city\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The Rostvs knew everybody in Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old count had money enough that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas, acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,  passed his time very gaily\"\n",
      "null\t\" After a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be  at home again\"\n",
      "null\t\" His despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from Gavrl to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing Snya on the slyhe now  recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and  wearing the Cross of St\"\n",
      "null\t\" George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing  men was training a trotter of his own for a race\"\n",
      "null\t\" He knew a lady on one  of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening\"\n",
      "null\t\" He led the mazurka at the Arkhrovs ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal Kmenski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a  colonel of forty to whom Densov had introduced him\"\n",
      "null\t\"  His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow\"\n",
      "null\t\" But still, as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of  as the angel incarnate\"\n",
      "null\t\" During Rostvs short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he  did not draw closer to Snya, but rather drifted away from her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and  prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he thought of Snya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself, Ah, there will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom  I do not yet know\"\n",
      "null\t\" There will be time enough to think about love when I  want to, but now I have no time\"\n",
      "null\t\" Besides, it seemed to him that the  society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood\"\n",
      "null\t\" He went to balls and into ladies society with an affectation of doing so against his  will\"\n",
      "null\t\" The races, the English Club, sprees with Densov, and visits to a certain housethat was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar!\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktst, the clubs head cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and  fish for this dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count had been a member and on the committee  of the club from the day it was founded\"\n",
      "null\t\" To him the club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagratin, for few men knew so well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of  their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete\"\n",
      "null\t\" The club cook and the steward listened to the counts orders with pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing  several thousand rubles\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well then, mind and have cocks comb in the turtle soup, you know!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The count considered\"\n",
      "null\t\"  We cant have lessyes, three\"\n",
      "null\t\" the mayonnaise, thats one,  said he, bending down a finger\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Then am I to order those large sterlets? asked the steward\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, it cant be helped if they wont take less\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, dear me! I  was forgetting\"\n",
      "null\t\" We must have another entre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who is going to get me the flowers? Dmtri! Eh, Dmtri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate, he said to the factotum  who appeared at his call\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hurry off and tell Maksm, the gardener,  to set the serfs to work\"\n",
      "null\t\" Say that everything out of the hothouses must  be brought here well wrapped up in felt\"\n",
      "null\t\" I must have two hundred pots  here on Friday\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having given several more orders, he was about to go to his little countess to have a rest, but remembering something else of importance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club  steward, and again began giving orders\"\n",
      "null\t\" A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count, handsome, rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by  his easy life in Moscow, entered the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, my boy, my heads in a whirl! said the old man with a smile,  as if he felt a little confused before his son\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now, if you would  only help a bit! I must have singers too\"\n",
      "null\t\" I shall have my own orchestra, but shouldnt we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like  that sort of thing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagratin worried himself less before the battle of Schn Grabern than you do now, said his son with a  smile\"\n",
      "null\t\"  The old count pretended to be angry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!\"\n",
      "null\t\" What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktst? said  he\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thats so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, thats not their business!\"\n",
      "null\t\" We  cant get them from anyone else\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hes not there himself, so youll have to go in and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyythe coachman Iptka knowsand look up the gypsy Ilyshka, the one who danced at Count Orlvs, you remember, in a  white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me\"\n",
      "null\t\" And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him? asked Nicholas,  laughing\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dear, dear!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Though she came upon the count in his dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to  excuse his costume\"\n",
      "null\t\" No matter at all, my dear count, she said, meekly closing her  eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre has arrived, and  now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have to see him  in any case\"\n",
      "null\t\" Thank God, Bors  is now on the staff\"\n",
      "null\t\" The count was delighted at Anna Mikhylovnas taking upon herself one  of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Tell Bezkhov to come\"\n",
      "null\t\" Is his wife with  him? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anna Mikhylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted  on her face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate, she said\"\n",
      "null\t\" If what  we hear is true, it is dreadful\"\n",
      "null\t\" How little we dreamed of such a thing when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul as young Bezkhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give  him what consolation I can\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Wh-what is the matter? asked both the young and old Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Anna Mikhylovna sighed deeply\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov, Mary Ivnovnas son, she said in a mysterious  whisper, has compromised her completely, they say\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre took him  up, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now\"\n",
      "null\t\" she has come here and that daredevil after her! said Anna Mikhylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile  betraying her sympathy for the daredevil, as she called Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the clubit will all blow  over\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next day, the third of March, soon after one oclock, two hundred and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagratin, to  dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had  been bewildered\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that time, the Russians were so used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it, while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an  event\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important, and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in December, nothing was said about the war and the last battle, as  though all were in a conspiracy of silence\"\n",
      "null\t\" The men who set the tone in conversationCount Rostopchn, Prince Yri Dolgorkov, Valev, Count Markv, and Prince Vyzemskidid not show themselves at the club, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the Moscovites who took their opinions from othersIly Rostv among themremained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject  of the war and without leaders\"\n",
      "null\t\" The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best  to be silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room, the bigwigs who guided the clubs opinion reappeared, and everybody  began speaking clearly and definitely\"\n",
      "null\t\" Reasons were found for the incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat, everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things  began to be said\"\n",
      "null\t\" These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a defective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszwski and of the Frenchman Langeron, Kutzovs incapacity, and (it was whispered) the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless  and insignificant people\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the army, the Russian army, everyone  declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor\"\n",
      "null\t\" The  soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagratin, distinguished by his Schn Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous  as his own\"\n",
      "null\t\" What also conduced to Bagratins being selected as Moscows hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city  and was a stranger there\"\n",
      "null\t\" In his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of  Suvrov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Moreover, paying such honor to Bagratin was the best way of  expressing disapproval and dislike of Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Had there been no Bagratin, it would have been necessary to  invent him, said the wit Shinshn, parodying the words of Voltaire\"\n",
      "null\t\" Kutzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,  calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr\"\n",
      "null\t\" All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorkovs saying: If you go on modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay, suggesting consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the words of Rostopchn, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by  our officers and men at Austerlitz\"\n",
      "null\t\" One had saved a standard, another  had killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded\"\n",
      "null\t\" Berg was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when wounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone  forward\"\n",
      "null\t\" Of Bolknski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife  with his eccentric father\"\n",
      "null\t\" On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled  with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime\"\n",
      "null\t\" The members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat, stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress,  and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftns\"\n",
      "null\t\" Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings, stood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in order  to offer their services\"\n",
      "null\t\" Most of those present were elderly, respected men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures  and voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual  places and met in certain habitual groups\"\n",
      "null\t\" A minority of those present were casual guestschiefly young men, among whom were Densov, Rostv, and Dlokhovwho was now again an officer in the Semnov  regiment\"\n",
      "null\t\" The faces of these young people, especially those who were military men, bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation, We are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs  to us\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Nesvtski was there as an old member of the club\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, who at his wifes command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,  went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull\"\n",
      "null\t\" Here, as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he  treated them with absent-minded contempt\"\n",
      "null\t\" By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests, and  so he went from one group to another\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some of the most important old men were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully  to hear the voices of well-known men\"\n",
      "null\t\" The largest circles formed round  Count Rostopchn, Valev, and Narshkin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostopchn was describing how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to  force their way through them with bayonets\"\n",
      "null\t\" Valev was confidentially telling that Uvrov had been sent from  Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the third circle, Narshkin was speaking of the meeting of the Austrian Council of War at which Suvrov crowed like a cock in reply to  the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals\"\n",
      "null\t\" Shinshn, standing close by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kutzov had evidently failed to learn from Suvrov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of  Kutzov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Ily Rostv, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft boots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up  young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Young Rostv stood at a window with Dlokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately  made and highly valued\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old count came up to them and pressed  Dlokhovs hand\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Please come and visit us\"\n",
      "null\t\" you know my brave boy\"\n",
      "null\t\" both playing the hero\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword, which, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall  porter\"\n",
      "null\t\" He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder, as when Rostv had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign  Orders, and the Star of St\"\n",
      "null\t\" George on his left breast\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was something navely festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile  features, gave him a rather comical expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bekleshv and Theodore Uvrov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,  as the guest of honor, to enter first\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin was embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay  at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first\"\n",
      "null\t\" He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at  Schn Grabernand he would have found that easier\"\n",
      "null\t\" The committeemen met him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting  for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagratin over each others shoulders, as if he were some rare  animal\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Ily Rostv, laughing and repeating the words, Make way, dear boy! Make way, make way! pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and  seated them on the center sofa\"\n",
      "null\t\" The bigwigs, the most respected members  of the club, beset the new arrivals\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Ily, again thrusting his way through the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver  which he presented to Prince Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" On the salver lay some verses  composed and printed in the heros honor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bagratin, on seeing the  salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help\"\n",
      "null\t\" But all eyes  demanded that he should submit\"\n",
      "null\t\" Feeling himself in their power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and  reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagratin (or he would, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his  attention to the verses\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, I will read them, then! Bagratin seemed to say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and  serious expression\"\n",
      "null\t\" But the author himself took the verses and began  reading them aloud\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bring glory then to Alexanders reign  And on the throne our Titus shield\"\n",
      "null\t\" A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man, A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field! Een fortunate Napoleon Knows by experience, now, Bagratin,  And dare not Herculean Russians trouble\"\n",
      "null\t\" Conquests joyful thunder waken,  Triumph, valiant Russians, now!\"\n",
      "null\t\" and Count Rostv, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading  his verses, bowed to Bagratin\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more important than verses, and Bagratin, again preceding all the  rest, went in to dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was seated in the place of honor between two AlexandersBekleshv and Narshkinwhich was a significant  allusion to the name of the sovereign\"\n",
      "null\t\" Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room, according to their rank and importance: the more important nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as water flows  deepest where the land lies lowest\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just before dinner, Count Ily Rostv presented his son to Bagratin, who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward, as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ily looked joyfully  and proudly around while Bagratin spoke to his son\"\n",
      "null\t\" Nicholas Rostv, with Densov and his new acquaintance, Dlokhov, sat  almost at the middle of the table\"\n",
      "null\t\" Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince  Nesvtski\"\n",
      "null\t\" Count Ily Rostv with the other members of the committee sat facing Bagratin and, as the very personification of Moscow  hospitality, did the honors to the prince\"\n",
      "null\t\"  His efforts had not been in vain\"\n",
      "null\t\" The dinner, both the Lenten and the other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the  end of the meal\"\n",
      "null\t\" He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the  footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everything  was excellent\"\n",
      "null\t\" With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of which Ily Rostv blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen  began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses\"\n",
      "null\t\" After the fish, which made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with  the other committeemen\"\n",
      "null\t\" There will be many toasts, its time to  begin, he whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose\"\n",
      "null\t\" All were  silent, waiting for what he would say\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor! he cried, and at the  same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm\"\n",
      "null\t\" The band immediately struck up Conquests joyful thunder  waken\"\n",
      "null\t\" All rose and cried Hurrah! Bagratin also rose and shouted Hurrah! in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted  it on the field at Schn Grabern\"\n",
      "null\t\" Young Rostvs ecstatic voice  could be heard above the three hundred others\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor! he roared, Hurrah! and  emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Many followed  his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging  remarks\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, To the health of the hero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivnovich Bagratin! and again his blue  eyes grew moist\"\n",
      "null\t\" Russians! Oer all barriers on! Courage conquest guarantees; Have we not Bagratin?  He brings foemen to their knees,\"\n",
      "null\t\" etc\"\n",
      "null\t\" They drank to Bekleshv, Narshkin, Uvrov, Dolgorkov, Aprksin, Valev, to the committee, to all the club members and to all the club guests, and finally to  Count Ily Rostv separately, as the organizer of the banquet\"\n",
      "null\t\" At that toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept  outright\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER IV\"\n",
      "null\t\" As usual, he ate and  drank much, and eagerly\"\n",
      "null\t\" But those who knew him intimately noticed that  some great change had come over him that day\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was silent all through dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his  nose\"\n",
      "null\t\" His face was depressed and gloomy\"\n",
      "null\t\" The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dlokhovs intimacy with his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles, but that his wifes connection with  Dlokhov was a secret to no one but himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess hints and the letter, but he feared  now to look at Dlokhov, who was sitting opposite him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Every time he chanced to meet Dlokhovs handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly  away\"\n",
      "null\t\" Involuntarily recalling his wifes past and her relations with Dlokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be  true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife\"\n",
      "null\t\" He involuntarily remembered how Dlokhov, who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come  to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion, Dlokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put  him up and lent him money\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre recalled how Hlne had smilingly expressed disapproval of Dlokhovs living at their house, and how cynically Dlokhov had praised his wifes beauty to him and from that  time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Yes, he is very handsome, thought Pierre, and I know him\"\n",
      "null\t\" It would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him,  and helped him\"\n",
      "null\t\" I know and understand what a spice that would add to the  pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, if it were true,  but I do not believe it\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have no right to, and cant, believe it\"\n",
      "null\t\" That expression  was often on Dlokhovs face when looking at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, he is a  bully, thought Pierre, to kill a man means nothing to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" It must  seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He must think that I, too, am afraid of himand in fact I am afraid of him, he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous  rising in his soul\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov, Densov, and Rostv were now sitting  opposite Pierre and seemed very gay\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was talking merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very  noticeable one at the dinner\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a wordan old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized  Rostv and had not responded to his greeting\"\n",
      "null\t\" When the Emperors health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his  glass\"\n",
      "null\t\" What are you about? shouted Rostv, looking at him in an ecstasy  of exasperation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till  all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Why, I didnt recognize you! he said\"\n",
      "null\t\" But Rostv was otherwise engaged; he was shouting Hurrah!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Confound him, hes a fool! said Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\"  One should make up to the husbands of pretty women, said Densov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking  about him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, now to the health of handsome women! said Dlokhov, and with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of  his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Heres to the health of lovely women, Peterkinand their  lovers! he added\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at  Dlokhov or answering him\"\n",
      "null\t\" The footman, who was distributing leaflets with Kutzovs cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the  principal guests\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was just going to take it when Dlokhov, leaning  across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre looked at Dlokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous  that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He leaned his whole massive body across the table\"\n",
      "null\t\"  How dare you take it? he shouted\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvtski and the  neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezkhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dont! Dont! What are you about? whispered their frightened  voices\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that smile of his which seemed to say, Ah! This is what I like!\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You\"\n",
      "null\t\"! you\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt that the question of his wifes guilt which had been tormenting him  the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative\"\n",
      "null\t\" He hated her and was forever sundered from her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Despite Densovs request that he would take no part in the matter, Rostv agreed to be Dlokhovs second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for  the duel with Nesvtski, Bezkhovs second\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre went home, but Rostv with Dlokhov and Densov stayed on at the club till late,  listening to the gypsies and other singers\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well then, till tomorrow at Soklniki, said Dlokhov, as he took  leave of Rostv in the club porch\"\n",
      "null\t\"  And do you feel quite calm? Rostv asked\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dlokhov paused\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, you see, Ill tell you the whole secret of dueling in two  words\"\n",
      "null\t\" If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be  killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain\"\n",
      "null\t\" But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostrom used to tell  me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone fears a bear, he says, but when you see one your fears all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!  And thats how it is with me\"\n",
      "null\t\" demain, mon cher\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvtski drove to the Soklniki forest and found Dlokhov, Densov, and Rostv already  there\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which  had no connection with the matter in hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" His haggard face was yellow\"\n",
      "null\t\" He looked about distractedly and  screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was entirely absorbed by two considerations: his wifes guilt, of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of Dlokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was  nothing to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should perhaps have done the same thing in his  place, thought Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its even certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or  he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee\"\n",
      "null\t\" Cant I go away from  here, run away, bury myself somewhere? passed through his mind\"\n",
      "null\t\" When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,  and the pistols loaded, Nesvtski went up to Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" I should not be doing my duty, Count, he said in timid tones, and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very  grave, moment I did not tell you the whole truth\"\n",
      "null\t\" I think there is no  sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it\"\n",
      "null\t\"  You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh yes, it is horribly stupid, said Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent will accept them, said Nesvtski (who like the others concerned in the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that  the affair had come to an actual duel)\"\n",
      "null\t\" You know, Count, it is much more honorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters become  irreparable\"\n",
      "null\t\" There was no insult on either side\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No! What is there to talk about? said Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Its all the  same\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only tell me where to go  and where to shoot, he said with an unnaturally gentle smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his handa fact that he  did not wish to confess\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot, said he\"\n",
      "null\t\" No apologies, none whatever, said Dlokhov to Densov (who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to  the appointed place\"\n",
      "null\t\" The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road, where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the  last few days\"\n",
      "null\t\" The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther  edge of the clearing\"\n",
      "null\t\" The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and Nesvtskis and Dlokhovs sabers, which were stuck into the  ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was thawing and misty; at  forty paces distance nothing could be seen\"\n",
      "null\t\" For three minutes all had  been ready, but they still delayed and all were silent\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER V\"\n",
      "null\t\"  All right, said Pierre, still smiling in the same way\"\n",
      "null\t\" A feeling  of dread was in the air\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of  mens will\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov first went to the barrier and announced: As the  advesawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Take your  pistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance\"\n",
      "null\t\"  O-ne! T-wo! Thwee! he shouted angrily and stepped aside\"\n",
      "null\t\" The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to  one another, beginning to see one another through the mist\"\n",
      "null\t\" They had the  right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dlokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his  bright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face\"\n",
      "null\t\" His mouth wore  its usual semblance of a smile\"\n",
      "null\t\" So I can fire when I like! said Pierre, and at the word three, he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and  stepping into the deep snow\"\n",
      "null\t\" He held the pistol in his right hand at  arms length, apparently afraid of shooting himself with it\"\n",
      "null\t\" His left hand he held carefully back, because he wished to support his right  hand with it and knew he must not do so\"\n",
      "null\t\" Having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, then quickly glanced at Dlokhov and, bending his finger as he had been  shown, fired\"\n",
      "null\t\" Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered  at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still\"\n",
      "null\t\" The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything  for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected\"\n",
      "null\t\" He only heard Dlokhovs hurried steps, and his figure came in view  through the smoke\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was pressing one hand to his left side, while  the other clutched his drooping pistol\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv ran  toward him and said something\"\n",
      "null\t\" No-o-o! muttered Dlokhov through his teeth, no, its not  over\"\n",
      "null\t\" And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the  saber, he sank on the snow beside it\"\n",
      "null\t\" His left hand was bloody; he wiped  it on his coat and supported himself with it\"\n",
      "null\t\" His frowning face was  pallid and quivered\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Plea\"\n",
      "null\t\" began Dlokhov, but could not at first pronounce the  word\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Please, he uttered with an effort\"\n",
      "null\t\" To your barrier! and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by  his saber\"\n",
      "null\t\" Only ten paces divided them\"\n",
      "null\t\" He sucked and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his  remaining strength\"\n",
      "null\t\" He raised his pistol and aimed\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Cover yourself! even Densov cried to his adversary\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing  Dlokhov and looked sorrowfully at him\"\n",
      "null\t\" Densov, Rostv, and  Nesvtski closed their eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" At the same instant they heard a report  and Dlokhovs angry cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Missed! shouted Dlokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards  on the snow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest, trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:\"\n",
      "null\t\" lies\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Rostv and Densov drove away with the wounded Dlokhov\"\n",
      "null\t\" The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer  a word to the questions addressed to him\"\n",
      "null\t\" But on entering Moscow he suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rostv, who  was sitting beside him, by the hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv was struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on  Dlokhovs face\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Well? How do you feel? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bad! But its not that, my friend said Dlokhov with a  gasping voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" Where are we? In Moscow, I know\"\n",
      "null\t\" She wont get over it! She wont  survive\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Who? asked Rostv\"\n",
      "null\t\" My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother, and  Dlokhov pressed Rostvs hand and burst into tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" When he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostv that he was  living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it\"\n",
      "null\t\" He implored Rostv to go on and prepare her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Rostv went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise learned that Dlokhov the brawler, Dlokhov the bully, lived in Moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate  of sons and brothers\"\n",
      "null\t\" CHAPTER VI\"\n",
      "null\t\" Both in Petersburg and in  Moscow their house was always full of visitors\"\n",
      "null\t\" The night after the duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his  fathers room, that huge room in which Count Bezkhov had died\"\n",
      "null\t\" He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that  had happened to him, but could not do so\"\n",
      "null\t\" Such a storm of feelings, thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the  room with rapid steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on her face, and then immediately he saw beside her Dlokhovs handsome, insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when  he reeled and sank on the snow\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What has happened? he asked himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" I have killed her lover,  yes, killed my wifes lover\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come  to do it?Because you married her, answered an inner voice\"\n",
      "null\t\"  But in what was I to blame? he asked\"\n",
      "null\t\" In marrying her without  loving her; in deceiving yourself and her\"\n",
      "null\t\" And he vividly recalled that moment after supper at Prince Vaslis, when he spoke those  words he had found so difficult to utter: I love you\"\n",
      "null\t\" It all  comes from that! Even then I felt it, he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" I felt then that  it was not so, that I had no right to do it\"\n",
      "null\t\" And so it turns out\"\n",
      "null\t\" Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful  understanding of his employers happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty and social tact, thought he; been proud of my house, in which she  received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty\"\n",
      "null\t\" So this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand  her\"\n",
      "null\t\" How often when considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires, and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved  woman\"\n",
      "null\t\" Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become  clear\"\n",
      "null\t\" Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her  naked shoulders\"\n",
      "null\t\" She did not give him the money, but let herself be  kissed\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: Let  him do what he pleases, she used to say of me\"\n",
      "null\t\" One day I asked her if  she felt any symptoms of pregnancy\"\n",
      "null\t\" She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going  to have any children by me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had  been brought up in the most aristocratic circles\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Im not such a fool\"\n",
      "null\t\" Just you try it on\"\n",
      "null\t\" Often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not  love her\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * You clear out of this\"\n",
      "null\t\" Yes, I never loved her, said he to himself; I knew she was a  depraved woman, he repeated, but dared not admit it to myself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what  is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles\"\n",
      "null\t\" He  digested his sufferings alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" It is all, all her fault, he said to himself; but what of that? Why did I bind myself to her? Why did I say Je vous aime * to her,  which was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure\"\n",
      "null\t\" what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, thats  nonsense, he thought\"\n",
      "null\t\" The slur on my name and honorthats all  apart from myself\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * I love you\"\n",
      "null\t\" Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a criminal, came into Pierres head, and from their point of view they were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a  martyrs death for his sake\"\n",
      "null\t\" Then Robespierre was beheaded for being  a despot\"\n",
      "null\t\" Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are  alivelive: tomorrow youll die as I might have died an hour ago\"\n",
      "null\t\" But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections, she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break  and tear whatever came to his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why did I tell her that Je  vous aime? he kept repeating to himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" And when he had said it for the tenth time, Molires words: Mais que diable allait-il faire dans cette galre? * occurred to him, and he began to laugh at  himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to  Petersburg\"\n",
      "null\t\" He resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his  intention to part from her forever\"\n",
      "null\t\" Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre  was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression,  unable to realize where he was\"\n",
      "null\t\" The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at  home, said the valet\"\n",
      "null\t\" But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was  a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow\"\n",
      "null\t\" With her  imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet\"\n",
      "null\t\" She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it\"\n",
      "null\t\" She waited till the  valet had set down the coffee things and left the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her  enemies, he tried to continue reading\"\n",
      "null\t\" But feeling this to be senseless  and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to  go\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, whats this now? What have you been up to now, I should like  to know? she asked sternly\"\n",
      "null\t\"  I? What have I\"\n",
      "null\t\"? stammered Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but  could not reply\"\n",
      "null\t\"  If you wont answer, Ill tell you\"\n",
      "null\t\" You  believe everything youre told\"\n",
      "null\t\" You were told\"\n",
      "null\t\" What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what  you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause\"\n",
      "null\t\" Hlne raised her voice and became more and more excited, A man  whos a better man than you in every way\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hm\"\n",
      "null\t\"! growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and  not moving a muscle\"\n",
      "null\t\" And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer  yours\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Dont speak to me\"\n",
      "null\t\" Why shouldnt I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,  said she\"\n",
      "null\t\" Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange  expression she did not understand, and lay down again\"\n",
      "null\t\" He was suffering physically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could  not breathe\"\n",
      "null\t\" He knew that he must do something to put an end to this  suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible\"\n",
      "null\t\"  We had better separate, he muttered in a broken voice\"\n",
      "null\t\" Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune, said  Hlne\"\n",
      "null\t\" Separate! Thats a thing to frighten me with!\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill kill you! he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her  brandishing the slab\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Hlnes face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside\"\n",
      "null\t\" His  fathers nature showed itself in Pierre\"\n",
      "null\t\" He felt the fascination and  delight of frenzy\"\n",
      "null\t\" He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping down on her with outstretched hands shouted, Get out! in such a  terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror\"\n",
      "null\t\" God knows what  he would have done at that moment had Hlne not fled from the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left  for Petersburg alone\"\n",
      "null\t\" Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had  not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners\"\n",
      "null\t\" What was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among  strangers and unable to send news of himself\"\n",
      "null\t\" The gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians  had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince understood from this official report that our army had been  defeated\"\n",
      "null\t\" A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kutzov informing the prince of the fate that had  befallen his son\"\n",
      "null\t\" Your son, wrote Kutzov, fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regimenthe fell as a hero, worthy of  his father and his fatherland\"\n",
      "null\t\" To the great regret of myself and of the  whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not\"\n",
      "null\t\" I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of  battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce\"\n",
      "null\t\" After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though  he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his  lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ah, Princess Mary! he said suddenly in an unnatural voice,  throwing down his chisel\"\n",
      "null\t\" (The wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that  wheel, which merged in her memory with what followed\"\n",
      "null\t\")\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her  eyes grew dim\"\n",
      "null\t\" By the expression of her fathers face, not sad, not crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and  incomprehensiblethe death of one she loved\"\n",
      "null\t\" Father! Andrew!said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father  could not bear her look but turned away with a sob\"\n",
      "null\t\" Bad news! Hes not among the prisoners nor among the killed!  Kutzov writes\"\n",
      "null\t\" and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to  drive the princess away by that scream\"\n",
      "null\t\" Killed!\"\n",
      "null\t\" She was already pale, but on hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her  beautiful, radiant eyes\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was as if joya supreme joy apart from the  joys and sorrows of this worldoverflowed the great grief within her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and  drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck\"\n",
      "null\t\" Father, she said, do not turn away from me, let us weep  together\"\n",
      "null\t\" Scoundrels! Blackguards! shrieked the old man, turning his face  away from her\"\n",
      "null\t\" Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go,  go and tell Lise\"\n",
      "null\t\" The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and  wept\"\n",
      "null\t\" She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took  leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud\"\n",
      "null\t\" She saw him tender  and amused as he was when he put on the little icon\"\n",
      "null\t\" Did he believe? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms  of eternal peace and blessedness? she thought\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Father, tell me how it happened, she asked through her tears\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and  Russias glory were led to destruction\"\n",
      "null\t\" Go, Princess Mary\"\n",
      "null\t\" When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm  peculiar to pregnant women\"\n",
      "null\t\" It was evident that her eyes did not see  Princess Mary but were looking within\"\n",
      "null\t\" into herself\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mary, she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying  back, give me your hand\"\n",
      "null\t\" She took her sister-in-laws hand and  held it below her waist\"\n",
      "null\t\" Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained  lifted in childlike happiness\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her  sister-in-laws dress\"\n",
      "null\t\"  There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange\"\n",
      "null\t\" And do you know, Mary, I am going to love him very much, said Lise, looking with  bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping\"\n",
      "null\t\" What is the matter, Mary?\"\n",
      "null\t\" sad about Andrew, she said, wiping  away her tears on her sister-in-laws knee\"\n",
      "null\t\" Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to  prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry\"\n",
      "null\t\" Unobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not  understand, agitated her\"\n",
      "null\t\" She said nothing but looked about uneasily as  if in search of something\"\n",
      "null\t\" Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign  expression and went out again without saying a word\"\n",
      "null\t\" She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women,  and suddenly began to cry\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Has anything come from Andrew? she asked\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, you know its too soon for news\"\n",
      "null\t\" But my father is anxious and I  feel afraid\"\n",
      "null\t\" So theres nothing?\"\n",
      "null\t\" She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the terrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected  within a few days\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid  their grief in their own way\"\n",
      "null\t\" The old prince would not cherish any hope: he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his  memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed\"\n",
      "null\t\" He tried not  to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him\"\n",
      "null\t\" He walked  less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary  hoped\"\n",
      "null\t\" She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news  of his return\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dearest, said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit, but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so now the smile of the little princessinfluenced by the general mood though without knowing its causewas such as to remind one still more  of the general sorrow\"\n",
      "null\t\" Dearest, Im afraid this mornings fruschtique *as Fka the  cook calls ithas disagreed with me\"\n",
      "null\t\"  * Frhstck: breakfast\"\n",
      "null\t\"  What is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, you are very pale! said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,  ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law\"\n",
      "null\t\" Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdnovna be sent for? said one  of the maids who was present\"\n",
      "null\t\" (Mary Bogdnovna was a midwife from the  neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight\"\n",
      "null\t\")\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ill go\"\n",
      "null\t\" She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room\"\n",
      "null\t\"  No, its only indigestion?\"\n",
      "null\t\" Say its only indigestion, say so,  Mary! Say\"\n",
      "null\t\" And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some  affectation\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary  Bogdnovna\"\n",
      "null\t\"  Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh! she heard as she left the room\"\n",
      "null\t\" The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump  white hands with an air of calm importance\"\n",
      "null\t\" Mary Bogdnovna, I think its beginning! said Princess Mary  looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess, said Mary Bogdnovna, not  hastening her steps\"\n",
      "null\t\" You young ladies should not know anything about  it\"\n",
      "null\t\" But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet? said the  princess\"\n",
      "null\t\" (In accordance with Lises and Prince Andrews wishes they had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at  any moment\"\n",
      "null\t\")\"\n",
      "null\t\" Well manage very well without a doctor\"\n",
      "null\t\" Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy  being carried by\"\n",
      "null\t\" The men servants were carrying the  large leather sofa from Prince Andrews study into the bedroom\"\n",
      "null\t\" On  their faces was a quiet and solemn look\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching  what was going on in the passage\"\n",
      "null\t\" Some women passing with quiet steps in  and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away\"\n",
      "null\t\" She did not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before  the icon stand\"\n",
      "null\t\" To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers  did not calm her excitement\"\n",
      "null\t\" Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse, Praskvya Svishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl  round her head\"\n",
      "null\t\" Ive come to sit with you a bit, Msha, said the nurse, and here Ive brought the princes wedding candles to light before his  saint, my angel, she said with a sigh\"\n",
      "null\t\" Oh, nurse, Im so glad!\"\n",
      "null\t\" The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door  with her knitting\"\n",
      "null\t\" Princess Mary took a book and began reading\"\n",
      "null\t\" Everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced  as she sat in her room\"\n",
      "null\t\" But owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princes household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished  at that moment made itself felt\"\n"
