I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.

I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.

Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.\\n\\nI walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.\\n\\nWe got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.  \\n\\nPlus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet \\\"queen Bentley\\\". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!\\n\\nEven when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night. \\n\\nThank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.\", \"date\": \"2017-01-14 21:05:04\"}\n",
