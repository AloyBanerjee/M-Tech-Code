I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! \\n\\nThis place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. \\n\\nMore fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. \\n\\nIt is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it.

Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:\\n\\n- We were staying a nearby hotel.\\n- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.\\n- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.\\n- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!\\n- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.\\n- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.\\n\\nNow I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.\\n\\n- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...\\n- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. \\n- Clean the bathroom!!\\n\\nWill probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.\", \"date\": \"2017-01-02 04:12:17\"}\n",
